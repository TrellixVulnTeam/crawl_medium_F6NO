The process was very simple. To make an income, I provided my time and skills in exchange for money.

01/2019	“Alexa, play some music” isn’t the only time Amazon is listening to you.	-	5.5K	63	https://medium.com/@jasonvoiovich	https://medium.com/swlh/alexa-play-some-music-isnt-the-only-time-amazon-is-listening-to-you-a556df19613f?source=collection_archive---------1-----------------------	12	1	['“Alexa, play some music” isn’t the only time Amazon is listening to you.']	63	['Amazon’s voice recognition software only listens when you say the word “Alexa,” right?', 'That’s what most Echo and Dot buyers think because that’s what the advertising leads you to believe. As if by magic, your Alexa-enabled device “wakes up” when you say its name. But think about that for a moment. After you say the magic word, your Alexa-enabled device must listen for your request, interpret it, and respond. Just how much does Amazon really listen to inside your home? How much you really know about how voice technology works when you unboxed your Alexa-enabled device?', '(Fair warning: this is about to get awkward.)', 'You may have assumed your Echo or Dot listened and responded using the small computer housed inside the device itself. But that doesn’t make sense. The on-board computer simply isn’t powerful enough. And besides, Amazon continues to update the device. It must do this from a centralized server location. That’s the only place where there is enough computing power not only to interpret your request, but also to update Alexa with new “skills” from third-party vendors. That’s how your device now knows how to order a pizza. Amazon needed to partner with Domino’s Pizza (in the United States) to develop that interface.', 'Now that you know that your voice recordings are being sent via the internet to a centralized location, you may have assumed Amazon will need to store that data for some period of time — for example, to use its Natural Language Processing algorithms to interpret your request for a weather report (or to buy a pizza), gather that information, and then send it back to your device for it to speak the response. The transaction happens so quickly that you assume Amazon would have no reason to keep the recording of your voice any longer than a few seconds. Besides, is that even feasible? Think of how much storage space Amazon would require for all of the audio files. Is there really a database somewhere storing all your “requests for weather reports?”', 'Those are good questions.', 'Imagine for a moment that you were curious about what, precisely, your Amazon Echo or Dot device recorded in your home. Now that you know it’s listening, you’d like to know what it heard. To satisfy that curiosity and put your mind at ease, you ask Amazon to send you a copy of the data your device has collected since you bought it.', 'After a few weeks, you receive your audio files from Amazon. Imagine your horror as you open the attachments and begin listening to the recordings: A discussion of what to have for dinner, two children arguing over a toy, a woman talking to her partner as she gets into the shower. You weren’t really sure if Amazon would keep recordings at all. And if they did keep recordings, you thought your Echo or Dot recorded only your explicit requests.', 'But it gets worse. You don’t recognize any of the voices. With equal parts relief and horror, you realize you are listening to someone else’s Echo recordings!', 'As it turns out, all of your assumptions about voice technology were wrong.', 'This story isn’t a thought experiment. It is precisely what happened when a German citizen who requested his data files from Amazon under the European Union’s GDPR regulation. He expected to get a list of the products he has purchased, how he paid, and other commercial profile data Amazon compiled. Unlike my scenario, he wasn’t expecting audio recordings. He didn’t own an Alexa-enabled device. He shouldn’t have been getting any recordings, yet there they were.', 'According to the story originally reported by the German investigative magazine c’t, Amazon admitted the mistake, citing human error in sending him the wrong file.', '(The statement fails to mention if the company notified the person whose data was shared. Also, Amazon was only compelled to comply with the request for data because the requestor was a European Union citizen. If you’re an American, or from anywhere outside the EU, good luck.)', 'In case any of the impact of the story escaped your notice, let’s take a moment to summarize what this all means in simple terms, shall we?', 'To put it in even simpler terms, if you own an Amazon Alexa-enabled device, Jeff Bezos could be the least creepy person listening to you right now.', 'Are you okay trading your privacy in your home for a weather report?', 'Or asked a different way: Is that weather report worth someone at Amazon listening to:', 'Are you okay with a random person (who received your data file by mistake) listening to that? Are you okay with a hacker listening to that? Your health insurance company? The police?', 'I used to believe this was a “boogieman” issue — that worst-case scenarios like the one described didn’t really happen. I used to believe people who rang the warning bell were at best, premature fools, and at worst, fear-mongering opportunists. I used to believe those things, but I was wrong.', 'The European Union’s 2018 GDPR consumer protection law cast a light under the bed and showed us all that the boogieman is real. And he’s listening to you right now.', 'An interjection here: Amazon is quick to point out that users (all users, not just EU users) can review and delete recordings. I’ve seen the interface myself. They’re also emphatic that the “wake word” is the key…the device only listens once it “hears” that word. My concern is that we’ve seen too many errors (creepy laughter and inappropriate responses to name just two) that indicate we might want to take a deeper look and ask tougher questions. Nonetheless, I appreciate Amazon’s point of view and take them at their word that they’re working on it. I’ve added their formal response to the bottom of this article.', 'The tyranny of menus and why is “voice” such a big deal.', 'To understand why companies are investing so much in voice recognition technology, and why they risk invading your privacy, you have to understand how objectively poor today’s “digital” experience is and how it got that way.', 'Voice is the natural way humans interact with others and their environment. But in the early days of the internet, interactive voice technology was neither advanced enough nor cheap enough to use outside of a few advanced laboratories. The most cost-effective voice technologies of the day were “telephone menu tree” systems that infuriated even the most patient callers.', 'If a “natural” interface wasn’t ready for the birth of the internet, what was the next best alternative?', 'Cascading menus.', 'Borrowed from library science, the menu structure is a software engineer’s dream. It’s logical, orderly, and hierarchical. Unfortunately, menus are not how people naturally interact with information. Menus do not mimic how our brains work. Menus are not easy to use.', 'Menus are terrible user interfaces for most everyday functions.', 'As just one example, think about this simple use case: I would like to play Prince’s “1999” on my iPhone. Here are the menu-driven steps I can take:', 'Six steps. Multiple taps and scrolls. Complex, artificial, robotic.', 'Or, consider this voice-based alternative:', '“Siri, play Prince’s 1999.”', 'Four words. One voice command step. Simple, natural, intuitive.', 'Menus are so common, we almost forget how unnatural they are. Menus don’t only dominate the user interface of smartphones, computers, tablets, and websites, but we find them everywhere — kiosks, airport terminals, medical devices, automobiles, and home appliances.', 'Think about it: That infuriating menu in your Toyota Camry, your CPAP machine, or your GE refrigerator is an ugly holdover from the early days of GopherNet and ARPANET … just like the QWERTY keyboard is an ugly holdover from the early days of IBM typewriters.', 'That’s why voice is such a big deal.', 'Menu interactions may be behavioral (and in many ways superior to opinion-based evidence), but they are still untethered to our true thought processes. Voice interactions are different — and not the type of robotic voice commands you give your car; those are simply audio menus, and they are terrible — no, the true potential of voice is unlocked with Natural Language Processing algorithms that learn to interpret and respond to natural human speech patterns. The best of them are learning our cadence, pitch, tone, accent, and volume \xad– and most importantly, our intent.', 'In a menu-driven world, our devices aren’t listening to us, they are waiting for an input. However, when a device is listening, it doesn’t need to wait to respond. It can make suggestions to you in real time, just as another person would do in a conversation. That’s the quantum leap voice technology promises: For the first time in human history, machines can truly interact with us.', 'But as we’ve seen, that’s not how people think voice technology works. Because we are so used to machines waiting for our commands, we’re not conscious that many of them are now listening to us go about our daily lives.', 'I’m not sure “voice” can be trusted. Yet.', 'Contrary to the image created by advertising of a fully conversational human-computer interface (a la the Star Trek “computer” or “J.A.R.V.I.S.” from Marvel’s Iron Man), if you try to hold a “conversation” today with Alexa, Cortana, Siri, or Google, you will be disappointed.', 'Most people who use voice technology quickly learn its limitations and adjust their expectations. In fact, most people use Alexa-enabled devices to tell give them weather reports or to play on-demand music. That’s it.', 'But if voice technology is to improve, its developers need to listen to and analyze many more interactions. Their argument for listening is simple: As consumers get better at interacting with voice technology, the technology will learn and improve. As the technology improves, consumers will expand their use of it. It’s a positive feedback loop that will (eventually) give birth to a real “J.A.R.V.I.S.” And when that happens, you’ll love it.', 'Perhaps. But until that day comes, you’re giving up your privacy for a weather report.', 'At this point, it’s fair to argue that we’ve given up our “privacy” for all manner of technological benefits and services. True, but up to this point those technologies operated on your explicit command. No one forces you to use Google Maps. No one forces you to share personal details on Facebook. No one forces you to buy from Amazon.', 'But voice is different.', 'Voice is a form of biometric data — something that is uniquely yours. Additionally, voice technology invades your privacy in an insidious way, always listening, always recording, and always learning more. You can see why organizations want voice analysis so desperately. It’s finally able to break into your “inner self” versus relying on your opinions or waiting for your command.', 'Voice technology is the ultimate behavioral study that you didn’t realize was happening.', 'Here’s the bottom line: Until organizations demonstrate they can be trusted with our private data, I’m not sure they deserve to have us give it to them for free. What’s more, they are unlikely to stop collecting your data on their own. As we’ve discussed, they need that data to improve their voice technology, and you’re willingly giving it to them. Why would they stop? They simply hope you aren’t paying attention.', 'It’s time that changed.', 'Here are a few easy things you can do today to start you on the path to reasserting the privacy in your own home:', 'Sorry, tech companies will not protect your privacy out of the goodness of their heart. It is up to you, as the consumer, to take action.', 'Your voice is yours. Keep it that way.', 'A response from Amazon:', '“We’ve built in multiple layers of privacy protections into Echo devices. By default, Echo devices are designed to detect only the wake word “Alexa.” The device detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device detects the wake word. Customers can review voice recordings associated with their account and delete those voice recordings one by one or all at once in the Alexa app or at https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacy.”', '– Amazon Spokesperson', 'About Jason Voiovich', 'Jason’s arrival in marketing was doomed from birth. He was born into a family of artists, immigrants, and entrepreneurs. Frankly, it’s lucky he didn’t end up as a circus performer. He’s sure he would have fallen off the tightrope by now. His father was an advertising creative director. One grandfather manufactured the first disposable coffee filters in pre-Castro Cuba. Another grandfather invented the bazooka. Yet another invented Neapolitan ice cream (really!). He was destined to advertise the first disposable ice cream grenade launcher. But the ice cream just kept melting!', 'He took bizarre ideas like these into the University of Wisconsin, the University of Minnesota, and MIT’s Sloan School of Management. It should surprise no one that they are all embarrassed to have let him in.', 'These days, instead of trying to invent novelty snack dispensers, Jason has dedicated his career to finding marketing’s north star, refocusing it on building healthy relationships between consumers and businesses, between patients and clinicians, and between citizens and organizations. That’s a tall order in a data-driven world. But it’s crucial, and here’s why: As technology advances, it becomes ordinary and expected. As relationships and trust expand, they become stronger and more resilient.

Of those, an overwhelming amount split their equity evenly.', '“A quick, even split suggests that the founders don’t have the business maturity to have a tough dialogue”', '— Noah Wasserman', 'Whether because of avoidance, too much optimism, or lack of knowledge, founder teams that split their equity by default were also found, per Wasserman’s research, to have triple levels of unhappiness within their teams.', 'Which begs the question why?', 'It all comes down to fairness.', 'Over time, different work styles, personalities, and issues around contribution emerge. One founder may be putting more hours in, or another may be contributing more capital, which cause questions around the equity split to pop up.', 'Is it still fair?', 'If I am working 60 hours a week, but my co-founder is only putting in 40 hours, I deserve more.', 'I’m more committed. I should be the one making any final decisions for the company.', 'For founders, the equity split also helps determine decision-making power.', 'An even split means that the founders will need consensus. If questions pop up around the fairness of the equity split, and the founders are unable to resolve these issues, impasses and the inability to move forward can negatively impact the company. Resentments build, frustrations rise, and the team becomes dysfunctional.', 'That’s why how you decide equity early-on will have a lasting impact on the co-founder dynamic and the company.', 'Increase the startup’s chances of success by taking these questions into account when having your equity allocation conversation.', 'Any previous business experience a founder has in building a company should be given more weight when dividing equity.', 'Building a startup is difficult work, and any prior experience fundraising, connections to investors, creating an MVP, or scaling a product are invaluable assets that increase the startup’s chances of success.', 'For most first-time founders this is a tough sell. The other non-business or non-technical founders will see this as unfair and the idea person, if not the person with prior business experience, will believe that the idea is worth more.', '“…[T]he “idea person” insists that the idea is 90% of the value (and 90% of the equity). In the real world, the “idea” is a very small part of the overall equation. A startup is all about “execution” — meaning the equity should be allocated based on the value that each partner brings to the table.”', '— Martin Zwilling', 'The idea is only part of the equation; being able to execute on it is much more critical.', 'Take for example Myspace and Facebook. These two similar social networking sites each executed their ideas differently. Facebook accomplished it better, building a series of features that kept it dominant in the social media space, whereas Myspace didn’t and faded into obscurity.', 'For that reason making sure the startup has the resources and capital to grow, and execute on the idea, is ultimately why the business founder should be allocated more equity.', 'Remember, if a startup fails because the business didn’t grow and execute, 50% of nothing is zero.', 'As you work through the equity allocation conversation, the question of value will repeatedly pop up.', 'What is everyone bringing to the table?', 'How will everyone contribute to the startup’s success?', 'What skills are more valuable than others?', 'However the conversation goes, these questions help determine what cash and non-cash contributions each founder is bringing to the startup.', 'Depending on the founder team, each of these contributions will have a different weight.', 'Pro Tip: Issue convertible debt or a series seed preferred stock for any initial capital contributions, treating it the same way you would a seed investor.', 'The value of each of these contributions will determine the level of commitment you need from each founder.', 'Is everyone in it for the long-haul?', 'Will we all work on this full-time or is this a side gig?', 'What happens to our equity if our commitment level increases, decreases, or one of us leaves?', 'Enthusiasm will be high when you first start. Everyone will be fired up to want to work. However, over time this can change. Funding isn’t coming in. The MVP is taking longer to build. Resources are starting to running dry.', 'Take for example the following:', 'A founder has taken sweat equity instead of a salary. He doesn’t have a stable source of income, and after about a year and a half, the startup still isn’t bringing in any stable revenue. The founder is getting discouraged. There’s hope in a seed financing round, but he thinks that the stakes are too high and may be time for him to leave. He wants to retain his equity. What would you do?', 'This situation is pretty standard, which is why it is essential to be upfront about commitment (and be clear as to what happens when someone leaves).', 'Pro tip: Whatever distribution you decide upon, make sure the founder’s shares vest over a period of time (usually four years) and include clear guidelines within the partnership agreement for what happens to a founder’s share should they quit, are forced out, or leave voluntarily.', 'It just doesn’t make sense to give a bigger share to a founder who is only half committed, will leave after a year or two, or has a lower level of risk.', 'Get clear on each founder’s commitment level, make sure their equity shares vest over time, and how everyone will deliver on their commitment.', 'The short answer is yes.', 'Known as the Founder’s Pie Calculator, this is one method for quantifying the various elements that go into the decision-making process of dividing equity that was created by Frank Demmler.', 'This formula incorporates all of the considerations regarding business acumen, value, and commitment into five distinct categories that the founders then have to adapt to their situation.', 'It causes everyone to have a negotiation upfront as to how they value each. By having this type of conversation in the beginning, everyone has the opportunity to “test” the founder relationship and see if you all can come out equally satisfied at the end.', 'The five different elements in the Founder’s Pie Calculator are:', 'Demmler also cautions that each element may have a different weight apportioned to it (a number from 1 to 10) depending on the industry that the startup is operating in.', 'For example, the idea component may be given more weight should the company be based upon new technology or the business component should the startup need considerable capital to launch the idea.', 'The below charts create the structure for having these conversations.', 'To illustrate this, Demmler uses an example of a high technology startup coming from a university program with a four founder team:', 'Seen in the chart below, the team collaborates and decides that the weight of the Idea will be seven, the Business Plan two, Domain Expertise five, Commitment & Risk seven, and Responsibilities six. The founders must also indicate how each element applies to them from 1 to 10.', 'Each element’s weight is then multiplied by the ranked level of the founder and added up to indicate the founder’s equity split. For example, founder 1 has a ranking of 10 for Ideas, meaning that he contributed the most to this. We multiply 10 by the weight of 7 to get 70 points. We repeat this process as shown below:', 'In this case, Founder 1 would have 33%, Founder 2 44.2%, Founder 3 16.5% and Founder 4 6.2% of the company.', 'Way different than a traditional even split, which is what most founder teams decide upon. The process takes time, may be uncomfortable, but will give a founder team security that their equity split is fair. .', 'However, while the tool is a great resource guide for creating structure to the equity conversation, it may leave some individuals feeling devalued. In this example Founder 4 comes out with the least amount of equity and may not leave the equity allocation conversation happy.', 'Fairness also means that everyone should leave the equity conversation valued.', 'Truth be told, you’ll spend more time with the founder team than even your spouse, so there’s an added interest in making sure everyone is happy with the end result.', '“A co-founder team is a lot like marriage, but without the sex.”', '— Mike Nicholls', 'This is a relationship you’ll want to start with where everyone feels valued. A lot of the equity conversation comes down to “control” of the business.', 'Will everyone get an equal say?', 'How will decisions be made amongst us?', 'Will your get the resources you need to execute on your ideas?', 'As part of the work I do as a mediator for equity restructuring conversations, a lot of the final pushes toward a solution comes down to everyone feeling equally valued (even if the equity redistribution isn’t equal).', 'There are more than one way to make someone feel valued beyond equity.', 'Give everyone an equal ability to contribute, making sure that the final equity decision you come up with makes everyone feel valued for what they are bringing to the table. Even if that means you have to give up a percentage point or two to get everyone there.', 'Having the actual equity conversation can be hard.', 'It has the potential of triggering a lot of hard and difficult emotions, especially when you’re relying on everyone to discuss their potential, what they feel they are worth, and matching that to an actual equity share. For that reason take your time with the process.', 'I recommend founders complete this worksheet, 20 Questions to Ask a Potential Co-Founder, prior to having an equity conversation to see if everyone is truly aligned.', 'Lastly, other things you’ll want to consider include:', 'As you test out potential co-founder relationships, remember that not everyone will be the right fit even if they look good on paper. Do a small project together to get a feel for them personally or wait to allocate equity until after you’ve accomplished something. Alignment is key.', 'I am a mediator that specializes in resolving equity co-founder disputes.', 'I have had the unique privilege of brokering deals between founders when the stakes are high, restructuring their equity when everyone felt there was no moving forward. I have found that no two conversations are ever the same, and it really comes down to the founder’s willingness to move forward together.

As a programmer, your biggest challenge is to keep yourself up-to-date. Technology changes very fast and you will see a new version of your favorite programming language and framework coming to every year.', 'For Java developers, the last, couple of years has brought plentiful changes and posed a challenge with keeping up-to-date with a new Java version every 6 months, Spring 5, Spring Security 5, and Spring Boot 2, etc.  When I started this year, I thought Java 11 was new and before I could finish learning Java 11 completely, Java 14 and Java 15 were already out.', 'So, they came really fast but came with a lot of interesting features like Records, var with local variables, API enhancements, GC improvement, Thread Local handshake, and many more. I have documented them here and I am really excited to use those in 2021. The same goes with Spring framework and Spring Security, I didn’t know all the changes on Spring 4.0 and Spring Security 4.0, my project was still using Spring Security 3.1, and boom we now we have version 5.0 for both Spring and Spring security. My learning speed has slowed down a little bit in last couple of years and I haven’t managed to keep myself up-to-date with the latest and greatest like I am yet to get comfortable with Git, JavaScript frameworks like Angular and React, latest changes on unit and integration testing space and new version of popular framework e.g. Spring, Spring Security, and Spring Boot. I managed to catch up many of those last years, hence, 2021 will be all about consolidation and keeping myself up-to-date with things which matter most on the technology side, improving my toolset chain, and exploring the DevOps landscape', 'This is one area where I am seeing a lot of traction last year as more and more companies are moving into DevOps and adopting continuous integration and deployment. DevOps is very vast and you need to learn a lot of tools and principles and that’s what overwhelms many developers but you don’t need to worry. I have shared a DevOps RoadMap which you can follow to learn and master DevOps at your own speed. This means if you are an experienced Java programmer with a passion for managing the environment, automation, and improving overall structure, you can become a DevOps Engineer. If you are looking for some awesome resources then Jenkins, From Zero to Hero: Become a DevOps Jenkins Master is a great course to start with, particularly for Java developers.', 'Git and Github have been around some time and while I have used Git in past with Eclipse, but I am yet to become a master of Git on the command line. Why I haven’t mastered Git so far? Simply because I didn’t need it yet. I have occasionally downloaded projects from Github and run from Eclipse but I am still not so great with Git commands, particularly reverting changes and handling errors.  Since now most of the companies are migrating their projects from SVN, CVS to Git, its high time to learn and master Git. I have recently purchased the Git Complete: The definitive, step-by-step guide to Git from Udemy on their last 10$ sale and this would be the first item to complete in 2021.', 'If you are in the same boat and want to learn or improve your Git skill in 2021, do check out that course from Udemy, it’s very handy.', 'As I said, I am still learning Java 8 and many Java developers too. I will also spend some time learning new features of Java 9, Java 10, Java 11 in 2021 but for me, Java 8 is still a priority, until I moved to Java 11 which is another LTS release. The JDK 9 brings a lot of goodies in terms of modules, Jigsaw, Reactive Streams, Process API, HTTP2 client, JShell, and API improvements like collection factory methods and I am really looking forward to learning them at the earliest opportunity. Similarly, JDK 10 brings var to give you a flavor of dynamic typing and some GC improvement.  In the last Udemy 10$ sale, I have purchased a host of courses and one of them is The Complete Java MasterClass, which is updated for Java 11 and I am looking forward to starting my Java 11 journey with that.  Btw, if you have yet to start with JDK 8 then here is my list of favorite Java 8 tutorials and courses which you can free of cost: 10 best tutorial to learn Java 8.', 'If you need a list of courses to learn new features from Java 9 to Java 13 then you can take a look at this list of courses to learn new features from JDK 9 to JDK 13.', 'I have been hearing about some new features like the reactive programming model on Spring 5, adoption of recent Java features, some unit testing improvement, etc but I have yet to try that. Anyway, I have already started learning Spring 5.0 by following Spring 5. 0: Beginner to Guru and will keep the momentum going in 2021. If you use Spring, probably it’s the best time to learn Spring 5.0.', 'If you like books, you can also check out this list of advanced Spring Books for Java developers from Manning and Packt_Pub', 'Another area which I want to improve in the coming year. There are a lot of new frameworks and tools available for Java programmers to unit test and integration test their application e.g. Mockito and PowerMock for mocking objects, Robot Framework, and Cucumber for automated integration test and of course the new and shining JUnit 5 library. There is plenty of stuff to learn on this front. If you can invest some time upgrading your unit testing skill, not only your coding skill will improve but also you will become a more professional developer, which every company looks form. To start with, you can check out the JUnit and Mockito Crash Course from Udemy.', 'One more thing I want to keep improving in 2021 is my knowledge about writing REST API and implementing secure and scalable RESTful Web Service in Java using Spring.  This is one skill that is highly desirable in the Java world and there are not many people who know both Java and REST well.', 'If you are also in the same boat and want to learn how to develop RESTful Web Service using Spring, The REST of Spring MasterClass from Eugen Paraschiv is a good starting point.', 'This is the third major upgrade on Spring Eco-System. The 5th version of the popular security framework has several bug fixes and a major OAuth 2 module, which you just can’t miss. This is another priority Item for me in 2021 along with Spring 5.0 framework stuff.', 'Thankfully Eugen has updated his best-selling course Learn with Spring Security to include 5.0 features and added a separate module for OAuth 2.0., probably the best material to learn Spring Security 5.0 at this moment.', 'The Spring Boot framework also has a new release Spring Boot 2. If I get sometime after all these goals this year then I will spend some time learning Spring Boot 2.', 'If you also want to learn Spring Boot 2, you can check out this free Spring boot course from Udemy for a quick start.', 'If you need more choices then you can also check this list of top Spring boot courses for Java developers to learn in 2021.', 'These two JavaScript framework has completely changed how you develop web applications.', 'As a Java developer, I have used Servlet, JSP, and jQuery at the client side but haven’t yet tried my hand with Angular or React.  In 2021, one of my goals is to learn Angular and I will be starting my journey with Udemy’s Angular 9 - The Complete Guide. If you are in the same boat then you can also take a look at that course, it’s very handy.', 'If you don’t know how to write Android Apps in 2021 then you are lacking something. Mobile is one of the best platforms to reach a large number of people and Android is probably the most popular platform to write mobile applications. Even though I know Android basics, I have yet to publish any Android apps, maybe 2021 will change that. If you want to learn Android in 2021, you can check The Complete Android N Developer Course, one of the better course to learn Android.', 'If you need more choices then I have also shortlisted some Android online courses to refresh my knowledge and get to the next level. If you are also in the same boat then you may find them useful as well.', 'One more thing I want to keeping exploring in-depth in 2021 is the Big Data space, and particularly Apache Spark and Apache Kafka framework.', ""I am not sure if I will get time to look at other Big data technologies but it's seriously good stuff and along with DevOps and Machine Learning, Big Data is probably the hottest technology at this moment.  If you also want to learn Big data in 2021, you can check The Ultimate Hands-On Hadoop — Tame your Big Data! course."", 'If you need more choices you can also check my list of shortlisted courses to learn Apache Spark for Java developers from Udemy and Pluralsight.', 'You’ve probably heard the buzz around Docker and Kubernetes and the impact it has on DevOps teams. You may have at first thought, “ahh, yet another new technology I need to learn”, but I will say that Docker is not just another technology but its truly a game-changer.  Along with Kubernetes, It’s one of the most important tools that you can learn and will stay with you throughout your entire career.  Nowadays, Docker and Kubernetes are used by almost every development team, whether it’s a large enterprise or a small startup. It’s safe to say that if you’re entering the workforce now, you’ll most likely brush up against Docker at some point.  In short, whether you are a junior Java developer or an experienced veteran with several years of experience, Having Docker and Kubernetes knowledge is essential for your career progression and job change. If you have already realized the importance of Kubernetes and looking to learn Kubernetes in 2021 then Docker and Kubernetes: The Complete Guide by Stephen Grider on Udemy is an excellent course to start with.', 'If you prefer free resources, like free online courses, then you can also check out this list of free Docker and Kubernetes courses for Java developers to start your journey.', 'Microservices are nothing but an extension of RESTful web services with the main objective being to break up your code into small, distributed, and independent services for better development, deployment, and management.', 'The Microservices architecture is ideal for the public cloud, with its focus on elastic scaling with on-demand resources. However, it does require thoughtful design and a significant amount of preparation.', 'Fortunately, Spring Boot and Spring Cloud simplify your microservice applications by providing common features and allowing you to focus on business logic by abstracting away details required for cloud-based development.', 'If you also want to learn Spring Boot 2 and Microservice in 2021 then you can also check out this Master Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud from Udemy for a quick start.', 'If you need more choices, then you can also check this list of top Spring boot courses for Java developers to learn in 2021.', 'Apart from containers, Cloud is another thing that I think every Software developer and Data Scientist should learn in 2021. Companies of all sizes and domains are now shifting their environments into Cloud for cost-saving and better scalability, which means sooner or later, you need to work with cloud-native applications.', 'Learning Cloud platforms like Amazon Web Service (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or Microsoft Azure will take you one step ahead of your competitors not only in your current job but also in the next post. You don’t need to learn all of them, and in fact, learning one means you will have a fair idea about others.', 'To start with, I suggest you learn AWS as it is the most popular and most mature cloud platform and there is a strong demand for developers and system admins with AWS knowledge if you need a resource then I recommend the AWS Certified Solutions Architect — Associate 2021 course by Ryan Kroonenburg the Cloud Guru. It will not only help you learn AWS in-depth but also prepare you for AWS certification.', 'If you need free courses to learn AWS online, you can also check this list of best free AWS courses for beginners to start with.', 'Concurrency is one of the skills which separates an average developer from a good programmer. You should not only have an in-depth understanding of fundamental concepts like Thread, Runnable, Object locking, and Synchronization, but you should also be familiar with concepts like deadlock, livelock, race conditions, and how to deal with them.', 'You should also learn about advanced Java concepts like synchronizers added on Java 5 and subsequent version, I mean CyclicBarrier, CountDownLatch, Phaser, and CompleteableFuture, etc., along with Futures and how to perform the async operation in Java. I know, it’s a lot of stuff, and that’s why I suggest you join an in-depth course like Java Concurrency in Practice bundle from Heinz Kabutz, a Java Champion, and authority when it comes to concurrency and design patterns. This course is a bit expensive, but you will learn a lot more concepts in-depth, which makes it completely worth your time and money.', 'On the other hand, if the price is an issue, you can also check this Udemy course to Efficient Java Multithreading with Executors, which won’t cost you more than $10 if you get it on Udemy flash sales which happens every month. This is also an excellent course to learn Java concurrency and multithreading in Java.', 'That’s all about what to learn in 2021. As I have said, Technology changes with rapid speed, and the biggest challenge for programmers are to keep themselves up-to-date.', 'Apart from this list, there is plenty of other stuff that you can look-up in the new year like learning a new programming language like Kotlin but for me, I will be more than happy if I can achieve these goals in 2021.  Other Programming Resources and Articles You may like', 'The 2021 Java Developer RoadMap 10 Books Every Programmer Must Read 10 Tips to Improve Your Programming skill 10 Object-Oriented Design Principle Every Programmer should know 10 Articles Every Programmer Should Read 10 Tools Every Software Developer Should Know 10 Data Structure and Algorithms Courses for Programmers 5 Java and Web Development Frameworks Programmers Should Learn 10 Unit testing and Integration testing tools for Java devs', 'Thanks for reading this article so far.

Wrong.', 'When asked how we are doing we routinely respond with “busy”.', 'Busy is B.S.. It’s a lazy answer. It’s also a sure way to look back after a decade and wonder what the hell happened. You’ll be left wondering, “What did I accomplish?”', 'Do you hide from your problems, by distracting yourself with a beehive of activity? Are you running away from your anxiety and angst? Perhaps that’s because you are unwilling to confront your problems. Your solution to your problems is to stuff them down deep inside to a place where you don’t have to deal with them. Unfortunately, these pesky feelings eventually rear their ugly heads.', 'What you must do is slow down, think, and find solitude. For in solitude you finally allow yourself to confront your problems and face them head-on. The only way to get rid of that sense of anxiety and worry is to stop and think.

Many thought this would crush his spirits and likely be the end of his career. Roosevelt thought otherwise.', 'In the depressing surroundings of his hospital bed and surrounded by a melancholy group of family and friends, Roosevelt made it a point to put on a bright and cheery disposition. Whether this was for the betterment of the people he cared for or for his own sake did not matter, the effect was noticeable.', 'By pretending to be happy and cheerful he began to feel better. By acting happy, he did what a happy person would do. By acting happy he actually became happy.', 'The disease may have robbed him of the use of his legs but it would not rob him of his ability to think for himself or to choose how he felt.', 'With this attitude, he made a miraculous, albeit incredibly difficult recovery. With incredible determination, he built his way back into the public arena, despite never regaining use of his legs. Roosevelt bravely overcame his fears of being embarrassed by his disease in front of millions of people in the public arena.', 'He bravely forged ahead and became one of the strongest presidents of the United States in two of the most trying times in its history, the Great Depression and the Second World War.', 'The man that had to rebuild his own body, helped to rebuild the body of the United States after two debilitating blows. He never would have been able to do any of this had he not believed in the power for anyone and everyone to change and recover from their worst nightmares.', 'If you want anything in life, it’s up to you. No outside force is strong enough to push you into what you want. You must be responsible for securing it.', 'What do you wish to happen in your life?

Will you resort to self-sabotaging behaviors or will you work to recognize these pitfalls and overcome them?', 'The world’s best athletes aren’t the best because they are leaps and bounds more athletically gifted than their competition. At the highest level of competition, everyone is an incredible athlete. What separates the average from the great athlete is the time spent training their minds.', 'They confront their greatest fears. They become a student of their behaviors, routines, and rituals. They learn what is holding them back, nearly always it’s mental.', 'From there they train their minds, they reshape it and take back control of a reckless mind. Rather than being their greatest weakness they turn it into their greatest advantage.

Success is a lousy teacher.', 'When you achieve a certain level your mind slowly shifts away from seeking greater heights to holding onto what you have.

Other people have been there before or have had it worse. Misery may love company, but if you find the company that has overcome that misery, then there’s a light at the end of the tunnel for you. The path is there.', 'Furthermore, stoics teach what happens in life is out of your control. The only thing you can control is how you react to events as they unfold. As Epictetus said, “We cannot choose our external circumstances, but we can always choose how we respond to them.”', 'This line of thinking is liberating. Rather than spending costly time and energy trying to control what you cannot, redirect your energies to what you can…yourself. Your actions.

They wanted to see how well the arenas and venues they were playing at paid attention to the details because their lives could depend on it.', 'Their shows were extravagant with lights, stages, special effects, and all sorts of potentially dangerous equipment everywhere. The test was the brown M&Ms test. Their backstage rider included a demand to remove all the brown M&Ms from their bowl of candy.

Repetition', '2. Reflection', '3. Teaching', '4. Transfer', 'Learn to Learn Better']	60	['Aleksandar Hemon was 44 when he arrived in Chicago in 1992 from his native Sarajevo.', 'A journalist by trade who spoke no English, he set out to master the language of his newly-adopted home and publish an article within five years.', 'Working as a canvasser and door-to-door salesman, Hemon learned English, and within three years, he published his first story.', 'Today, Hemon has contributed to the New Yorker, the Paris Review and The New York Times, among other publications. He’s penned award-winning novels (in English) and received both MacArthur and Guggenheim fellowships for his writing.', 'They say you can’t teach an old dog new tricks. As Hemon’s story proves, that couldn’t be further from the truth.', 'Learning isn’t confined to primary school and the youthful days of university — which is a good thing, considering how much time college kids spend socializing, partying and generally not learning.', 'Instead, learning should be a never-ending pursuit.', 'Motivational speaker Jim Rohn once said that the world’s most successful people are lifelong learners. They understand that their level of education determines their quality of life.', 'I’ve written before about the Buddhist concept of “Beginner’s Mind” — the idea that we’re always learning; always a beginner, ready to absorb new perspectives.', 'Adopting a Beginner’s Mind increases our creativity, humility and gratitude. That’s why I try to continually learn: I read Hacker News, several blogs, and at least one nonfiction book at all times. I stay active on interesting discussion forums.', 'I also try to hire world-class consultants who can teach our teams, because we rarely know what we don’t know.', 'We choose a few people to meet weekly with these consultants to discuss strategies and gather advice. In areas where we didn’t have enough core competency (like SEO), we’ve seen tremendous success from this approach.', 'In today’s knowledge economy, lifelong learning is more important than ever.', 'For example, technology has made most products and services significantly cheaper — a phenomenon that Peter Diamandis, author of Abundance, calls “demonetization.”', 'Diamandis argues that we’ve demonetized at least $900,000 worth of products and services that we would have purchased between 1969 and 1989. Take research — as Diamandis writes:', '“In years past, collecting obscure data was hard, expensive in time if you did it yourself, or expensive in money if you hired researchers. Today, during the Google Era, it’s free and the quality is 1000x better. Access to information, data and research is fully demonetized.”', 'At the same time, knowledge is increasingly valuable, particularly when it comes to innovation and leveraging new technologies. That’s why learning is the single best investment of our time.', 'Whether we’re studying a new language, like Hemon, or brushing up on our programming skills, there are several ways we can become better students, beginning with how we learn.', 'Metacognition, or thinking about thinking, is a valuable learning skill. And if you read the previous sentence, chances are you’re now thinking about your own thinking — and you’re already on your way to better learning.', 'You might expect that our capacity to learn boils down to IQ and how many hours we study each day.', 'But how we learn may be equally important. In fact, metacognitive activities like planning, monitoring, and reflecting can deeply enhance learning — on top of raw intelligence.', 'Marcel Veenman, director of research & training at the Institute for Metacognition Research, found that when it comes to learning something new, people who engage in metacognition outscore those who have sky-high IQ levels alone.', 'JotForm has 4.3 million users. I’d like to see that figure continue to rise. In order to do so, and to compete with the big dogs like Google, we need to maintain our edge in the crowded world of online forms.', 'We need to provide real value to our customers.', 'We need to keep learning.', 'Here’s how we can all continue our education — each and every day.', 'At some point, nearly all of us have pulled an all-nighter or done a last-minute cramming session. As it turns out, learning in multiple, spread-out sessions, known as “spaced repetition,” is a far more effective approach.', 'John Medina, author of Brain Rules, calls repetition the most powerful way to sear memories into the brain.', 'Maybe you’ve made a 2019 resolution to learn French. To leverage spaced repetition, you could start by creating a review schedule. Each night, carve out time to study, alternating between vocabulary and grammar. Limit the duration of these review sessions to 30 minutes, or as long as you can focus without distraction.', 'Next, establish a way to store and organize information. Software like Evernote and SuperMemo are great tools that are also easily accessible.', 'Finally, you’ll need a metric to track your progress. Measuring your gains will motivate you to continue.', 'While establishing a system requires some time upfront, spaced repetition helps us to retain information and can reduce our total learning time.', 'In 2016, productivity expert Scott Barry Kaufman found that 72% of people get creative ideas in the shower. I count myself as part of that group.', 'These epiphanies, or “shower ideas,” often happen while we’re engaged in an unrelated activity, because our brains make connections between information we’ve already consumed.', 'I’ve also had some of my best ideas during (or just after) intentional downtime. That’s one reason why we believe in giving employees paid time off — and we encourage them to actually use their vacation days.', 'Often, we assume that learning only happens while we’re cramming new ideas and concepts into our brains, when in fact, a lot happens during moments of mental quiet.', 'Take sleeping — a time of total cognitive rest when experts say we “tidy up” our existing knowledge. In a recent study of participants learning foreign language vocabulary, a good night’s sleep reduced practice time by 50%.', 'On the other hand, skimping on sleep harms your ability to acquire new information — and this includes details acquired before and after sleep deprivation.', 'As any teacher will attest, the best way to learn something is to explain it to someone else. This idea is backed up by the Learning Pyramid, a visual tool that demonstrates the most effective ways to learn.', 'According to the pyramid, people retain 90% of what they learn when they teach someone else or apply the information immediately. Compare that with a mere 10% of what we learn simply from reading.', 'Acting on new knowledge is one of the most effective ways to enhance retention. That’s why Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman came up with the Four-Step Feynman Technique, a learning aid that breaks down concepts into their most digestible versions.', 'As Feynman said,', '“If you can’t explain it in simple terms, then you don’t understand it.”', 'Distilling a subject into its basic parts not only boosts understanding, it also highlights knowledge gaps.', 'When we encounter those gaps, Feynman’s technique advises us to return to the source material and re-learn what’s missing.', 'I’ve written about teaching before, and how I use “co-piloting” to delegate projects. By walking and talking colleagues through a task, from start to finish, I always improve my own skills — and identify any shaky spots along the way.', 'Ever wonder how Elon Musk became a multi-industry expert? Aside from being a voracious learner, Musk’s cross-training between fields has helped him to achieve mastery in each.', 'Musk applies a technique called learning transfer: taking what we study in one context and applying it to another.', 'For example, we could practice a mindfulness technique or a reading comprehension tool. We can also study multiple fields and use the information from one to enhance our understanding of another.', 'To apply knowledge in a new context, we have to think critically about it. For example, if I have a firm grasp of Spanish grammar rules, it will help me to learn French faster, too. And I’ll strengthen my Spanish language skills in the process.', 'Musk has a two-step process for learning transfer. First, he deconstructs the knowledge into its fundamental principles. Then, he reconstructs it in a new field.', 'As he explained on a Reddit AMA:', '“It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree — make sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e. the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang onto.”', 'Becoming an expert across fields also enhances innovation. Neuroscientist Nancy C. Andreasen, who studies creativity and the source of genius, has found that history’s most creative people, including Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, were polymaths.', 'Similarly, in a study of the 20th century’s best opera composers, researcher Dean Keith Simonton found that “the compositions of the most successful operatic composers tended to represent a mix of genres… composers were able to avoid the inflexibility of too much expertise (overtraining) by cross-training.”', 'So, ignore the old “jack-of-all-trades, master of none” adage, and feel free to explore multiple fields of study.', 'It’s no coincidence that successful people are dedicated to lifelong learning. In a world that moves at an ever-faster pace, we need both the skills and the ability to think critically about new concepts.', 'Most of us strive to become experts in our fields — and if, like Elon Musk, we can master several industries, that’s even better.', 'I hope these four techniques are helpful in your quest to learn better and faster.', 'Bonne chance!']

Every week or so, I meet a founder who asks me how my transition back has been, so this article was inevitable. For the uninitiated, I spent 2003–2018 outside of India, primarily in USA (14yrs) and UK (1yr) studying and then working in companies such as AMD (engineering), Google (bizdev), and Andreessen Horowitz (VC) and returned to India July’18 to join Lightspeed India as a Partner. I intend to write a series of “letters” here discussing my experiences moving back.', 'Living in India is just. plain. awesome! Family, friends, hospitality, tourism (in/around SE Asia), and the overall quality of life (subjectively) is much higher for me here. There are challenges that are apparent (traffic) and inherent (pollution) but both solvable (see later in the article).', 'The big learning for me is that the why of moving to India is way more important than the when and the how. There are two types of people who tend to be unhappy once they return:', 'Unless you are returning to India for starting up (talk to me if you are!), for a working professional, besides the right kind of job+salary, there are probably 3 things that impact the quality of life:', 'a) which city do you choose to live in (for family, friends, work etc)b) time to/from office (ideally < 30mins each way)c) where do you live (gym access, school/hospitals nearby, gated, etc).', 'If these three work out, rest follows a time for hobbies, money for travel, entertainment, etc.', 'The one thing that allows you to optimize for the good and avoid the bad?', 'Easy answer is “salary”, but this is where most people falter.', 'The trick is to know just how much should you make to most closely recreate a parallel lifestyle for what you had in the US. Instead of offering you my subjective opinion, I have done you one better and created a “move to India” salary calculator here to help you decide based on your current comp and lifestyle.', 'There are many vectors in a typical cost of living but I used to rent as a % of your total salary as the best representation of your “quality of life”. I know, I know, there are better ways, but this one is mine :) Also, it’s bay-area specific. You are welcome to copy the original gDoc and edit to your needs. Just plug in your US salary, and your current monthly rent, then select your India city of choice + size of your house and out comes a result. Here’s a fictional entry:', 'Note that the table won’t get everyone the right data; there are obvious corner cases I don’t cover (e.g. if you earn 1M$/yr and spend just 1k/mo in rent, you’ll get absurd results). However, if you are an average techie earning, say, 150K/yr and spending 2k/mo in rent, you would be better served. YMMV.', 'For those that don’t know me well, I went to the US in 2003 and have been visiting India 1–2 times a year till 2014 and often 3+ times a year since 2014 due to my father’s passing and my desire to start shifting my focus back home. So, I’ve been able to observe the small shifts better than most locals did, and of course, the macro-trends that are now obvious to most.', 'Overall, I couldn’t be happier with my move. I feel lucky to be in SE Asia / India at a time many of the growing pains have subsided and the startup ecosystem feels a lot more mature (more on that in a future post). As a VC, I wanted to be somewhere I could look back 10yrs out and feel like I made a difference and I strongly believe that with a lot of hard work and a dash of good fortune, I have a chance to make such an impact on India in 10 years. Moreover, from a macro POV, India is now globally #3 in terms of GDP by PPP and also #3 in the world for software projects checked into GitHub.', 'There is clearly an opportunity, ability to pay and the intent to build for the white-spaces. Rest is upon the founders, the VCs, and hopefully pleasant tailwinds :) Here’s to the next 10 years. Happy 2019, everyone — let’s crush it!', 'PS: If you are an entrepreneur planning to service India/APAC, feel free to drop me a deck at submit.lsip.com!']

You can even get into a peak state by being around certain types of people, the ones who inspire you to be the best version of yourself.', 'Only you know what gets you into a peak and passionate state. So, do whatever it is that gets you there, and then write down your goals. Declare what you’re going to do. Then write that goal down and visualize it’s achievement every single day until it becomes your reality.', 'When you think about this goal, don’t deviate from the natural flow of ideas that follow.', 'You can’t 10X your results by engaging in the same thinking and behaviors you’re currently performing. Consequently, while thinking about your goal, you’ll also get ideas about what you need to do, realistically, to achieve that goal.', 'Chances are, you don’t know what you don’t know. So you’ll need to start really educating yourself about how you could conceivably achieve your goal. You’ll need to get bolder about the work you’re doing. You’ll need to create more, and fail more. Over and over, in fact. Quantity is often the fastest path to quality.', 'Not only that but when you think about your 10X goal, you’ll probably have ideas that scare you. When you do work that scares you, you cross a boundary that most people never cross. Scary work is often highly profitable and valuable work.', 'Marketing is nothing more than applied psychology.', 'It’s about connecting with people, persuading them, and helping them.', 'Many people think marketing is a nasty or immoral thing.', 'Many “artists” don’t learn marketing because they don’t want to “sell out.”They want their work to be pure.', 'Academics are not better. Their work is not accessible to the common man.', 'Marketing is nothing more than making your work easier and better to find and use.', 'People aren’t magically going to appear and buy your stuff.', 'People aren’t going to magically appear and read your stuff.', 'Even right now: How did you land on this page? Look at the title of this article. I could have just as easily called it, “Advice for becoming successful.”', 'But would you have clicked on that article?', 'Probably not.', 'But you clicked on this one.', 'Why did you click on this one?', 'How did you get this far down?', 'Think about the experience.', 'Marketing is the “HOW” to whatever it is you do.', 'The reason most people aren’t successful is that they either fear or avoid marketing. For the same reason, most people are bad teachers. They’re more focused on content than the delivery and design of that content.', 'But the delivery — the HOW — is just as important IF NOT MORE IMPORTANT than WHAT you’re doing or WHY you’re doing it.', 'You could have the cure for cancer. But if you don’t market it well, you’ll never get your cure out there.', 'You could have the world’s most important message or greatest story, but no one will see it if you don’t promote and package it intelligently.', 'Founder of the exclusive entrepreneurial coaching platform, Strategic Coach, Dan Sullivan distinguishes between those who are in the “Time-and-Effort Economy” with those who are in the “Results Economy.”', 'If you’re in the time and effort economy, you are focused on being busy. You actually believe the amount of time and energy you put into something merits praise. Conversely, when you are in the results economy, you are only focused on achieving a specific result.', 'The bottom line is what matters, and thus, it becomes very important to find the most effective way to get there. This is a key difference between entrepreneurs and employees. As Sullivan says:', 'Entrepreneurs have crossed “the risk line” from the “Time-and-Effort Economy” to the “Results Economy.” For them, there’s no guaranteed income, no one writing them a paycheck every two weeks. They live by their ability to generate opportunity by creating value for their clientele. Sometimes, they — and you — will put in a lot of time and effort and get no result. Other times, they don’t put in much time and effort and get a big result. The focus for entrepreneurs always has to be on results or there’s no revenue coming in. If you work for an entrepreneur, guess what! This is true for you, too. Though you probably have a guaranteed income, it’s important to understand that the business you work in exists inside The Results Economy, even if you’re sheltered somewhat from seeing that. I say this not to make you feel insecure, but to show you how to succeed in this environment: by maximizing your results while minimizing the time and effort it takes to get them.', 'Most people don’t think in terms of results because their security is in a paycheck. However, when you shift your focus from how little you can do to how much you can do, you change how you work.', 'You start learning ways to accomplish more faster. You take on greater responsibility. You change your environment. And you also realize just how important sleep and rest are to achieving the highest possible results. Hence, you begin to take more and more time off and rest.', 'When you dedicate 80 percent of your energy to rest and self-improvement, then you have a lot of fodder and a very sharp saw to use during the time you’re actually working.', 'You’re thinking 10X bigger than everyone else. You’re operating under short timelines and high pressure. You can tax yourself to extremes while you work because you spend lots and lots of time resting and preparing.', 'The environments you work in should reflect the work you’re doing.', 'Doing several types of work in the same environment is ineffective. But people do it all the time. They sit in the same seat and mentally shift from one task to another.', 'A far better approach is to BATCH your activities and to do those activities in a relevant environment.', 'For example, when I write a blog post, I work in a quiet library where I have no distractions. Because my environment facilitates quality writing, and because I knew I’d be writing that day, I write a lot. It’s easier to write 2–5 blog posts in one sitting than to try writing one post at a time.', 'Ari Meisel, author and entrepreneur, batches his activities and alternates his environments to match the work he’s doing. On days he is recording podcasts, he goes to a studio and records about 5 podcast episodes in a single session.', 'On other days, he spends his whole day in meetings or on calls. He does this work at his friend’s apartment because it’s a much more engaging environment.', 'He also does a lot of writing, and does that at the SOHO HOUSE in New York City, because it’s a quiet environment with poor internet connection. The lack of connection stops him from surfing the web and even using his phone because he has bad reception.', 'Success and wealth are not all about money.', 'There are a lot of people who have money and have little “capital” in the other key areas of their lives.', 'Money, obviously, is very important. It solves a lot of problems. It speeds processes.', 'But money is a tool. It’s a means to an end. For those engaging in work they truly believe in, money is simply a tool for doing more work.', 'What is your WHY for what you’re doing or pursuing?', 'How could you possibly know your why?', 'More importantly, how could you know your REAL WHY?', 'It’s actually quite simple.', 'But it takes some radical honestly.', 'There’s an exercise I’ll walk you through to get to your WHY. And more importantly, once you know your deepest WHY for what you’re doing, you should operate FROM THAT STATE, not from your lower and base-level reasons.', 'When trying to understand why you do something, it’s better to ask “What” questions than “Why” questions, because “Why” questions tend to put people on the defensive.', 'Here’s a solid question you could ask yourself to understand your WHY.', 'What about ______________ is important to you?', 'Let’s say you want to start a business, or get a new cellphone, or go to the gym…', 'It could be big or small.', 'But put that thing in there.', 'What about “going to the gym” is important to you?', 'Then, you just write the first thing that comes to your mind: because I like feeling good.', 'Then you take your answer, and put it in the same question: What about ______________ is important to you?', 'So, given the previous answer: What about “feeling good” is important to you?', 'A simple way to structure this exercise is shown in the images just below.', 'So, you want to try to go 7-layers deep. Once you get to layers 5, 6, and 7, you’re going to have to be really honest with yourself.', 'Usually, you can answer layers 1–4 with your head. However, if you’re being really honest with yourself, and I mean REALLY HONEST, you’ll need to come from your heart to answer layers 5–7.', 'It’s at the deepest levels that you’ll discover your TRUE WHY for what you’re doing. Even if that something is as simple as getting a new cellphone or going to the gym.', 'But you want to remind yourself of your DEEPEST WHY when you’re doing something. And you want to operate from THAT LEVEL, because at your deepest level, you’ll be operating from your heart, not your head. Thus, your performance will be much deeper, more authentic, and powerful.', 'The stakes will be higher.', 'Suddenly, you’re not just going to the gym to “feel good,” but because you have a higher calling to perform and need to be as healthy as possible to make it happen (or whatever your deepest WHY is).', 'Your DEEPEST why will almost always expose something very personal about you, and about your fundamental beliefs about life.', 'You want to be aware of these things, and how/why they drive you to do what you’re doing.', 'If you truly go through this exercise in a genuine way, you should get some mental and emotional breakthroughs.', 'You should discover something about yourself, and why you are the way you are, and why you’re pursuing the specific things you are.', 'Know your why.', 'Then act from the DEEPEST and most powerful WHY you have.', 'You’ll be far more brilliant at what you do.', 'In order to be successful, you must believe in something.', 'You must have a stand.', 'All successful people and brands have a clear WHY.

Here’s The Honest Truth', 'Pros', 'Cons', 'Verdict:']	42	['14 months into my full-time marketing job, I decided it was time to start diversifying my revenue streams and experiment with different ways to make money. I had read in several different places that Fiverr was a solid option to consider for writers, so I decided to check it out. In October, I created a profile and became a live member of the Fiverr community.', 'The set-up was relatively simple, basically just providing a profile picture and some brief descriptions.', 'I noticed that Writing & Translation was a central category on the platform, which aligned with what I wanted to offer. My area of expertise is in the article/blog realm, and after a few days of browsing through other sellers pages to see whats works and what doesn’t, I created my first gig.', 'For those who don’t know, Fiverr is a marketplace that connects aspiring freelancers (sellers) with customers looking for specific services (buyers). There are a variety of different categories that your work can fall under from Financial Consulting to Logo Design. In order to make money, you have to create “gigs”, which are essentially a mini sales pitch that try to reel in potential buyers to purchase your services.', 'As with anything, there is no single recipe for success on Fiverr. I cannot give you a step by step guide to make 25k a year or build a funnel of reliable clients. What I can provide are my experiences and (hopefully) insights to help you decide whether or not Fiverr is a solid revenue stream for you to consider.', 'So, should you start freelancing on Fiverr? Let’s take an in depth look at the pros and cons.', 'In a few shorts months, I’ve done everything from writing blog posts for an upbeat coffee apparel company to website content for an exterminator.', 'It can be interesting to do research on such diverse industries that I honestly never cared about before.', 'If you enjoy working on a completely unique project every time, Fiverr might be the right fit.', 'The obvious pro is that you can make some pocket cash by doing something you enjoy.', 'Are you being paid fairly? Probably not in comparison to some other platforms and independent freelancers. However, at the end of the day, it is money that you would not have had otherwise. You also don’t have to spend time bidding on projects.', 'So far I haven’t made much, but transferring money over from Fiverr into my PayPal account is a good feeling regardless.', 'Fiverrs platform is fairly straightforward, and you can become an expert in finding what you need after a few minutes. The Fiverr staff is open to communicate any issues that you come across and responds fairly quickly. Since so many people are on Fiverr, most of your needs can be resolved after a quick Google search.', 'Fiverr also has it’s own forum where you can post questions, and people tend to be very helpful and informative.', 'Everyone starts at zero on day one. If you put in ten minutes per gig, making sure you optimize your copy to appeal to a potential buyer and throw a nice picture with it, you should be able to snag a few beginner jobs.', 'Here are several of my active gigs:', 'I didn’t do any self-promotion or marketing, but received several opportunities within my first month.', 'The hardest hump to get past is that first sale. Mine was an individual requesting I craft a Yelp review for him. This was something that could have easily taken 15 minutes, but I spent nearly two hours on it (roughly $2 per hour). When your starting out, a positive review is one step in the right direction and a negative one is 100 steps the other way.', 'Luckily, he liked what I wrote.', 'You have to learn how to deal with a variety of different people, work within a deadline, and produce content that aligns with what your client has requested. Some sellers may be difficult or unclear, so Fiverr also presents a good opportunity to practice handling clients in an appropriate manner.', 'In the beginning, you will have to undercut yourself.', 'I set my prices very low and still had interested buyers request custom orders for less.', 'Very few people will be fine with the price you set as a new seller, and leverage your lack of reviews to insensitive a customer order. This means you can send them an order where the two of you agree on the price, word count, etc.', 'Fiverr has the name Fiverr for a reason. Many gigs start at $5, and the platform takes 20% out of everything you sell. That means a $5 gig will only make you $4. Even if you sell 25 gigs, you aren’t really making that much.', 'The amount of time I spent researching competitors, new topics, and creating content, all for a mere $10 (technically $8), may not be worthwhile in the end. Fiverr basically encourages you to sell your services at low increments.', 'The trade off is that I may not be able to get any clients at all if I were an independent freelancer.', 'As I said above, Fiverr will send potential clients your way. However, before you have a steady stream of positive reviews, buyers may go elsewhere for an established seller. Since most of the price points are already so low, the difference between paying $5 for someone with no proof of work vs. paying $10 for a seller with 50 positive reviews will be worth it to most people.', 'Depending on your seller level, it usually takes 14 days to access your funds.', 'Building a list of repeat buyers doesn’t help you outside of Fiverr. You are basically at the mercy of the platform, as the policy on contacting people outside of Fiverr is incredibly strict. They will deactivate your account at any notice of exterior marketing.', 'This also means that at any time, Fiverr can make a change that will decimate your success. What if they decide to raise their commissions to 50%? Relying so heavily on someone or something else always comes with risks.', 'It sounds great, right? Work when you want, get paid to do what you love?', 'Not exactly.', 'Once a buyer has placed an order, that becomes your immediate priority. Even with my full-time marketing job, I would work during my lunch break and stay a few minutes late to complete an order ahead of schedule. You have to understand that in the beginning, there will be pressure to maintain a very high standard of work to ensure you don’t receive any negative reviews. This could mean sacrificing extra gigs (and money) to focus on the one’s you have.', 'To be the best on Fiverr, you have to generate a lot of reviews. The most surefire way to do this? Buy fake one’s.', 'I have not done this personally, but read multiple articles with “tricks” or “secrets” to excel on Fiverr. Creating your own reviews was in every one.', 'Some people will ask to buy your account, or strike up a random conversation in the messenger that has nothing to do with your service.', 'Fiverr isn’t like Uber, where matches are random, and the driver has some level of income security. Nothing is guaranteed.', 'If you are willing to (initially) do a lot of work for little pay, and learn how to position yourself on the Fiverr platform, then you may end up doing very well.', 'Just be aware that your gigs may never take off.', 'Personally, Fiverr hasn’t worked out great. This is mostly because I simply don’t have the extra time right now to churn out more content and sit around waiting for/promoting orders. Between my full-time job, writing on Medium, building a portfolio, maintaining a relatively strict fitness routine, researching other side hustles, and learning as much as I can, the value on Fiverr hasn’t equaled the time spent.', 'Diversifying revenue streams is my main project in 2019. There are so many cool and interesting ways for us to make money that most people would never consider outside of their career. Fiverr could be the missing piece of your portfolio.', 'Do you have an opinion on Fiverr or any similar platforms? Let me know in the comments, I am interested to hear about other people’s experiences.']

These are basic skills and will serve you for a long time.', 'Any investment made into these skills in terms of time, money and effort will help you to reap rewards throughout your career.', 'If you want to become a programmer then you ought to know data structure and algorithms well; there’s no way around it.', 'This is one of the important topics of any programming job interview and without you knowing basic data structures (e.g. array, linked list, map, set) it’s not possible to write a real-world application.', 'That’s why every programmer should put serious effort to learn data structures and algorithms during their computer science course.', 'Even If you are a self-taught programmer, then also you must know data structures and algorithms; in fact, many programming bootcamp will teach you data structures and algorithms as the first thing.', 'If you want to learn it for yourself then Data Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive Using Java is a good place to start.', 'Source control is used to store code and if you want to become a coder or software developer, you must know version control tools like Git and SVN.', 'Thankfully Git and Github have streamlined the market and now more than 70% of organizations use Git, so you can probably get away by just learning Git.', 'By the way, you should put some effort into learning Git well, and you should be comfortable with advanced version control concepts like branching and merging as well as the tool itself using both the command line and GUI.', 'For beginners, The GitHub Ultimate: Master Git and GitHub is a good place to start with.', 'There is not a single day when I have not used a text editor while working as programmers. It’s one of the essential tools even for non-programmers and anyone who works with computers.', 'I have mostly used NotePad on Windows and VI in Linux, but you have a lot of choices available in terms of advanced editors like Sublime and NotePad++, which provides IDE-like functionalities.', 'I suggest you spend some time learning your favorite editor and keyboard shortcuts, productivity tips are something you can learn. If you like Sublime then Sublime Text for Rapid Web Development is a good course to learn such things.', 'The modern IDE is the single most important tool for any programmers. For C, C++, and C# programmer, the choice is clear: Visual Studio. And for Python developers, Jupiter Notebook is getting better and better every day.', 'For Java programmers, there are three major IDEs to choose: Eclipse, NetBeans, and IntelliJ IDEA.', 'While Eclipse is my favorite, IntelliJ IDEA is probably the most powerful of them. If you happen to be an IntelliJ IDEA fan, then I suggest you go through IntelliJ IDEA Tricks to Boost Productivity for Java Devs to learn your IDE better.', 'SQL is a classic. It’s been around for more than 30 years and I think it will be around for another 30 years. Given the omnipresence of the database, it’s expected from a programmer that he is familiar with essential database concepts like normalization and table design along with SQL.', 'There are many databases, but knowing just one is enough. The key point is that you should be familiar with the database. You should know how to insert/update/delete data and write SQL queries to retrieve it.', 'Knowledge of advanced concepts like join an aggregate function is a big bonus and if you want to get that then The Complete SQL BootCamp is a great place to start with.', 'Like SQL, UNIX also has withstood the test of time.

If it’s not easy to start, it’ll be hell to finish.', '2. Less is room for more of what’s not there yet.', '3. The older you get, the slower you should decide.', '4.

The only person who can truly forgive you is you.']	38	['The most memorable birthday wish I ever received was my dad’s in 2017:', '“Stay as you are by changing every day.”', 'I’ve tried to heed this advice ever since, but it never seemed more relevant than today. 28 does feel different. At 27, I still thought of myself more as “a kid in his 20s” than “an almost-30-year-old.” But I don’t think it’s the numbers. They’ve never mattered to me all that much. I think it’s the experience.', 'In the past twelve months, cumulative growth has really kicked in. Personally, professionally, financially. I don’t feel like a greenhorn anymore, struggling to build a foundation. More like a survivor, sitting on a base plate made of concrete. Battered, but here to stay. Here to make a serious dent.', 'There’s much foolishness left in me, but it’s a lot less than it used to be. I now am, as Oscar Wilde said, “not young enough to know everything.” I am, however, old enough to realize I know very little, that it’ll always be very little, and that that’s okay. As I keep finding more dark spots on the map, I question which ones I need to shine a light on. If I really need to close all the gaps.', 'The following lessons have been 28 years in the making. They’re both from and for a 28-year-old. Reminders about which gaps to close and which ones to leave alone. Hang in there, kid. Stay tough. Keep surviving. Here’s to 28!', 'I believe in hard work. But I don’t believe in struggling just to struggle. All the best things in my life — work, hobbies, relationships — were easy to begin. Frictionless. But that’s why they felt worth enlarging, worth persisting through the difficult parts.', 'Writing, video editing, friends, girlfriends, fun carried me into them and grit carried me through. If that initial bit of fun is missing, however, that moment where you clench your teeth will never happen. It’ll just be pain all the way.', 'At 27, I would’ve thought I need 27 life lessons. At 28, I’m wondering if even 14 is too many. When I first explored minimalism, I loved the simplicity, the freedom, the feeling of less.', 'Eventually, though, I realized it’s not so much about what you subtract, but about what you make room for. Room to think. To add meaning by solving life’s big challenges one at a time. That’s where true equanimity lies. And whenever there’s no challenge, it’s still soothing to know you have this space.', 'At 28, my next year will only account for 3.6% of the entire time I’ve been alive. As their relative share gets smaller, we worry less about committing more years to singular causes as we get older. That’s a good thing, as long as you deliberately and slowly pick the right causes. But most people don’t.', 'They panic looking at an arbitrary number, like 30, or 40, or 50, and jump into huge obligations in an instant, not realizing how “quickly” they’ll find themselves wondering where they took a wrong turn ten years later.', 'If you’re 28 and haven’t found the right partner, wait longer. If you haven’t found the right job, sample more. And if you don’t like where and how you live, please, move. Don’t settle just yet. Step back. Think. Then decide.', 'For the last three times I was sick for more than two weeks, I can tell you exactly which source of stress caused my physical ailment. If you enjoy your work, money isn’t a big problem, and you keep your emotions in perspective, there’s quite little that can really throw you off your game.', 'I used to think I need to accomplish all these big things to be happy, but now I’ll gladly settle for not having to do things I don’t like. If you’re here for 30,000 days, 27,000 will be boring. Life’s about learning to love those days.', 'Besides overestimating how important it is to achieve our goals, we also tend to double-cross ourselves in trying to reach them. Instead of creating a moral contrast between who we are and who we should be to deserve what we want, we pretend we already are that person — and now we just need to wait.', 'In the quartet of being and having, now and in the future, we focus on the wrong ends: our now of being and our future of having. Flip that to what you have now and who you could be, and you’ll eliminate not just a lot of disappointment, and impatience, but the desire for many goals altogether.', 'A side effect of dreaming intensely about the future is missing the opportunities to create it with the tools you have available in the present.', 'The internet exists since 1990. If you were born in a 40-year-span around that, this is your shot. This whole web thing is 30 years old. New technologies take decades to fully reach the globe. Half the world isn’t even online.', 'Yet most people bank on VR, AR, AI, blockchain, and a dozen other trends, instead of leveraging the single-greatest tool that’s not just proven, but bound to stay. Don’t wait for the next big thing. It’s already here. Now’s the time.', 'Everyone wants to be a pioneer, but no one wants to let go of what’s working. Historically great companies have successfully disrupted and cannibalized themselves. Apple went from computers to music to phones to wearables. Netflix sacrificed DVDs for streaming and licenses for original content.', 'Reinventing yourself before you need to is hard, because in order to reassemble, you need to tear yourself apart. The good news is if you do it, it creates a positive, reinforcing cycle of humility. And the more success you rack up, the more important this becomes.', 'I guess it takes making a lot of money in a short time to see, but a full bank account is the same as a fit body, a rewarding relationship, or an optimistic mind: it’s easy to lose if you’re not careful, but with the right habits, you can always get it back.', 'Again, I’m not sure how to show this, but I know it breeds a lot of confidence. It’s a Get-Out-of-Jail-Free-card for our lifelong scarcity mindset with money.', 'I only ever accomplish long-term goals by the date I initially want to when I set them and completely forget them. The more targeted my effort, the less likely I’ll be on point. It’s just human nature. We misjudge time all the time.', 'Therefore, focus on minimum stress, not maximum output. Manage your expectations, not your calendar. Track good-enough days, not just complete victories. Make progress amidst the chaos of life. Eventually, you’ll get there.', 'Accounting for chaos means making room to fail. A low, but meaningful, achievable standard for today goes so much further than a high, powerful, challenging one for tomorrow. Or next week. Or the end of the year.', 'Do stuff. Do stuff. Do stuff. Then look around. Chances are, you’ll like what you see behind you. Gazing at the top of a mountain only exerts pressure.', 'Since we control so little, most of our work should be done on the inside. Sometimes, it’s our attitude we need to change. Sometimes, our actions. But when the outside world won’t comply, we’ll always, always, need to update our perceptions.', 'Did you do everything right? Is this a slog to push through? Or is your tactic not working? What obvious aspect did you miss? “What can I change about myself here” is a question almost always worth asking.', 'Will Smith is a big hero of mine. On Christmas, he said: “Love is help.” He also said that “everyone is having a hard time.” If that’s true, then peace is, at the very least, the absence of harm. And we all need peace of mind.', 'This means beyond not harming ourselves, we also can’t afford to harm one another. Life is short. And, until we offload it, our anger is our pain. I think the best we can do is skip it altogether. Ignore toxic people, share your frustration, get curious, do what you need to do, but make sure it leads to forgiveness.', 'Because everyone is struggling, everything is chaos, and no one really knows what they’re doing, you might as well trust yourself. I know it’s a cliché, but he put it so succinctly, I always keep coming back to this Steve Jobs quote:', 'Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.', 'More often than not, what we accept as given reality is only one of many possible outcomes. You can create your own options, but only if you run your own experiments. Your unique experience is the only data that matters.', 'For every one thing you get right, ten others will go wrong. But everyone is busy fixing their own mistakes, so they won’t have time to hold your hand while you cry about yours.', 'Ultimately though, none of that matters, because you’re the only one who can grant yourself the power to continue. To move on and reject regrets. Think of it this way: you can survive everything except death. And that, none of us can.', 'I wonder how many lessons I’ll see when I’m 29. I hope less than 14. For now, this is all I’d like my 28-year-old self to know. If he comes back to this on occasion, I think he can stay who he is — and change every day.']
02/2019	Why Technology’s Early Adopters Are Opting Out	There was always a financial cost to early adoption…	11.4K	55	https://medium.com/@hairyelefante	https://medium.com/s/story/the-growing-cost-of-early-adoption-75050e80b004?source=collection_archive---------6-----------------------	7	3	['The diffusion of innovation', 'What it means to “just get it” in the 21st century', 'Trust in the future']	31	['I recently installed a Nest thermostat in my house. Nest has been around for a while, but I’ve been hesitant to get one. I won’t go into the details of why we finally pulled the trigger, but it made sense to have more control of our home environment.', 'When the box arrived, I was excited. I felt like I was stepping into the future. Once I got it all wired up and began the setup, though, my original hesitation came flooding back.', 'Nest would like to use your location.', 'I almost bailed. This is when Nest stopped feeling like a fun, helpful device and started to feel like an intrusive portal. Yet another keyhole for a company (or whomever else) to peer into my family’s life. It was probably okay, I rationalized. It’s probably just sharing location and temperature data, I thought to myself.', 'I wouldn’t have had this conversation with myself a decade ago. As the internet grew and the iPhone came on the scene, it was exciting. I felt a reverence, almost gratitude for everything it enabled. Driven by curiosity and optimism, I signed up for any new service just to see what the future might hold. I was on the leading edge of early adopters.', 'Over the past few years, however, I’ve drifted away. I’m not the only one.', 'There’s always been a financial cost to early adoption. My uncle amassed a collection of LaserDiscs, only to have to start over when DVDs won. For him, the long-term impact was limited: some money out of pocket and a slightly bruised ego. Now, the equation is very different.', 'The cost of a new device is no longer just financial: it’s also deeply personal.', 'Today, each new device we purchase is a conscious decision to share an intimate piece of ourselves with a company whose goals may not align with our own. This exchange represents a fundamental shift in our relationship with technology and the companies that produce it. Adoption is no longer an ephemeral transaction of money for goods. It’s a permanent choice of personal exposure for convenience—and not just while you use the product. If a product fails, or a company folds, or you just stop using it, the data you provided can live on in perpetuity. This new dynamic is the Faustian bargain of a connected life, and it changes the value equation involved in choosing to adopt the next big thing. Our decisions become less about features and capabilities, and more about trust.', 'When Amazon says, “Don’t worry, Alexa isn’t listening all the time,” we have to decide if we trust them. When Facebook launches a video chat device days after announcing a security breach impacting 50 million user accounts, we have to decide if we’re willing to allow them to establish an ever-present eye in our home. When we plug in a new Nest thermostat for the first time, we have to decide if we are okay with Google peering into our daily habits. The cost of a new device is no longer just financial: it’s also deeply personal.', 'The adoption of new technologies is often represented on a normalized curve, with roughly 16 percent of the population falling into what is broadly characterized as early adopters.', 'Early adopters, as Simon Sinek puts it, are those who just get it. They understand what you’re doing, they see the value, and they’re here for it. The further you move into the curve, from the early majority to the laggards, the more you need to convince people to come along.', 'Early adopters have an optimistic enthusiasm and a higher tolerance for risk, both financial and social (remember the first people walking around with Google Glass?). It’s relatively easy to acquire them as customers. It doesn’t take a sophisticated marketing apparatus or a big budget to get them on board. As Sinek says, “Anyone can trip over [the first] 10 percent of the market.” Early adopters are critical because they create the fuel that allows an idea to gain momentum.', 'Early adopters provide initial cash flow and crucial product feedback, and they help establish social proof, showing more cautious consumers that this new thing is okay—all at a comparatively low cost of acquisition.', 'For a new product to find true mass market success, it has to move out of the early adopter group and gain acceptance in the early majority. This is sometimes referred to as crossing the chasm. Early adopters give new technologies the chance to make that leap. If companies had to invest in marketing to acquire more reticent consumer groups, the barrier to entry for new ideas would grow dramatically.', 'But what if early adopter enthusiasm began to erode? Is that optimistic 16 percent of the population immutable? Or is there a tipping point where the risk-to-value ratio flips and it no longer makes sense to be on the cutting edge?', 'There was something different about the Facebook Portal launch. When the new video chat device hit the market, Facebook didn’t make a play for the typical early adopter group—young, tech-savvy consumers. Instead, they targeted the new device toward a less traditionally “techy” audience — older adults and young families. You could make a lot of arguments as to why, but it comes back to the core principles of early adopters: they get what you’re doing, they see the value, and they’re here for it.', 'For Facebook, mired by endless scandals and data breaches, it became clear that the traditional early adopters did get what they were doing, but instead of value they saw risk, and they weren’t here for it. Facebook chose to target a less traditional demographic because the company felt they were less likely to see the possible risks.', 'Facebook Portal is a paragon of the new cost of early adoption. The product comes from a company whose relationship with consumers is shaky at best. It carries a lot of privacy implications. Hackers could access the camera, or the company could be flippant and irresponsible with the use and storage of video streams, as was reported with Amazon Ring. On top of that, Portal is not just a new device, but also a new piece in the ecosystem of Facebook products, which represents a bigger underlying hazard that is even harder to grapple with.', 'Today, each new device we purchase is a conscious decision to share an intimate piece of ourselves with a company whose goals may not align with our own.', 'As the technology ecosystem has grown, the number and types of devices we feed our personal data into have expanded. But, as linear thinkers, we continue to assess risk based on the individual device. Take my internal dialogue about the Nest thermostat. My inclination was to assess my risk tolerance based on the isolated feature set of that device — tracking location and temperature. In reality, the full picture is much broader. The data from my Nest doesn’t live in isolation; it feeds back into the ever-growing data Frankenstein that Google is constructing about me. My Nest data is now intermingling with my Gmail data and search history and Google Maps history and so on. Various A.I. munges this data to drive more and more of my life experience.', 'A product ecosystem means the power inherent in a single device is no longer linear. As each new device folds into an increasingly intimate data portrait, companies are able to glean insights with each new data point at an exponential rate. This potentially translates to exponential value, but it also carries exponential risk. It’s hard, however, for us to assess this kind of threat. Humans have difficulty thinking exponentially, so we default to assessing each device on its own merits.', 'All of this means that to be tech-savvy today isn’t to enthusiastically embrace new technology, but to understand potential hazards and think critically and deeply about our choices. As Facebook Portal illustrates, that shift has the potential to change the curve of technology adoption.', 'Over the past decade, our relationship with new technology has been tenuous. As early as 2012, a Pew Research study found that 54 percent of smartphone users chose not to download certain apps based on privacy concerns. A similar study in Great Britain in 2013 pegged that number at 66 percent. More recently, MusicWatch conducted a study on smart speaker use and found that 48 percent of respondents were concerned about privacy issues. As summarized by Digital Trends:', 'Nearly half of the 5,000 U.S. consumers aged 13 and older who were surveyed by MusicWatch, 48 percent specifically said they were concerned about privacy issues associated with their smart speakers, especially when using on-demand services like streaming music.', 'Yet, despite our misgivings, technology marches on. Our concerns about smartphones have not slowed their growth, and MusicWatch found that 55 percent of people still reported using a smart speaker to stream music.', 'As Florian Schaub, a researcher studying privacy concerns and smart speaker adoption at the University of Michigan, is quoted in Motherboard:', 'What was really concerning to me was this idea that “it’s just a little bit more info you give Google or Amazon, and they already know a lot about you, so how is that bad?” It’s representative of this constant erosion of what privacy means and what our privacy expectations are.', 'We’ve been engaged in this tug-of-war for years, pitting that persistent feeling of concern at the back of our minds against our often burning desire for the new. The coming decade may prove a litmus test for our long-term relationship with technology.', 'For years we have chosen to trust corporations with our personal data. Maybe it’s a cultural vestige of the technological optimism of postwar America, or maybe we are so eager to reach the future we’ve been promised that we are operating on blind faith. But there are signs that our enthusiasm is cracking. As we continue to hand over more of ourselves to companies, and as more of them fail to handle that relationship with respect, does there come a point when our goodwill dries up? Will trust always be something we give, or will it become something that must be earned? At what point does the cost of adoption become too high?', 'Thanks for reading!

Obsessed, even.', 'Recently, the author and Guardian journalist confessed that he’s “unreasonably fascinated by other people’s daily schedules.”', 'His mental library includes specific details, like how fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld sleeps exactly seven hours a night (regardless of when he goes to bed) or that Out of Africa writer Karen Blixen (pen name Isak Dinesen) subsisted on oysters, champagne and amphetamines.', 'Burkeman says, like all humans, he’s a natural voyeur. He also admits that he’s looking for tips; ways to boost his own success.', 'And he’s not alone.', 'Lately, we’ve seen an explosion of articles, podcasts, blog posts, and books on the topic of daily routines.', 'So naturally… I’m going to share my own. While I would never consider myself a public figure like Lagerfeld, people often ask how I structure my days at JotForm — and if I can offer a few hints or tricks in the process, I’m happy to reveal what I can.', 'Wake up', 'My trainer is waiting for me at the gym. Knowing that I’ll stand him up if I hit “snooze” quickly gets my feet on the floor. We work out together for an hour, with a combination of cardio and weight training.', 'Arrive at the office. I grab a fresh cup of coffee (heaven) and open AI Writer on my computer.', 'Creative time. This is the most important part of my workday. It would be so easy to answer emails and get lost in my inbox, but I protect these hours at all costs.', 'After the gym, my brain is full of oxygen and I can think clearly. What do I think about? Anything from business problems to product ideas.', 'First, I write morning pages to get the garbage out, then I see what bubbles up. By the end of those two hours, I try to structure my thoughts into an actionable format, whether that’s an email, a plan, or a presentation.', 'I don’t always sit at the computer for two full hours, either. Sometimes a conversation fuels creative thought, so I might chat with a colleague or team member', 'When your business or your work is going well, it’s easy to shift into automatic. That approach works for a while, but eventually, success demands change. And even if change is slow, staying in automatic can mean missed opportunities.', 'Creative time should also include strategic thinking. When you feel clear and energetic, and you’re flowing in those peak hours, try to dig in and look at what’s going on in your business or your work life: What are the weak points? What’s going well? How can you amplify your current success?', 'Game-changing ideas won’t happen when you’re on a (metaphorical) treadmill. But if you think deeply and look for solutions, you will eventually find them.', 'Walk to lunch, either with someone from our team or a local colleague.', 'Eat lunch and get to know our employees better. I often learn as much from these conversations as I do during meetings and demo days. From personal goals to product issues, we cover it all. The 30-minute walk each way is equally energizing.', 'Meetings and emails. I used to routinely stay at the office until 8 pm or later, but my oldest son just started kindergarten, and I wasn’t seeing him very much. I decided that I would pick him up at 5 pm, at least four days a week (Tuesdays are longer meeting days).', 'Now that I’m home earlier, I’m reminded of an obvious truth: young kids are exhausting. I get down on the floor and play with them for an hour, then I need to rest for an hour. Then we play again. This continues until their bedtime.', 'When I’m not playing, I read or watch a TV show — usually something light, like House, Mars or nature documentaries. Never the news. It makes me crazy. I love having so much time at home now, and I try not to work during the evening. Separating work and family is important to me, and I encourage — and often require — our staff to do the same.', 'Work creates more work. The more time we spend developing new ideas, the more time we’ll need to spend executing them. That’s not necessarily a problem, but here’s what’s more important: creating work that matters.', 'Meaningful work requires deep, focused concentration, but it also demands downtime. Stepping away from the office, when possible, allows your mind to reshuffle the deck. Rest can generate more breakthroughs than metaphorically banging your head against the wall for 10+ hours a day.', 'In the 13 years since I started JotForm, I’ve also learned to hone in on critical problems and ideas. My days at the office aren’t (usually) very long, but I try to make every minute count.', 'Even leaving my desk and taking employees to lunch keeps me connected to every part of the company. I realize that’s a privilege, but it’s also my job as a leader.', 'Identify your most meaningful work, and what helps you to produce it. Then, do everything in your power to create a schedule that supports, instead of depletes, your individual genius.', 'A recent survey of nearly 1,200 U.S. workers found that 76% of participants said they felt tired many days of the week, and at least 15% fell asleep during the day at least once a week.', 'Poor or inadequate sleep can certainly be a problem, but several other factors can also affect our energy — and how we structure our days. Over the years, I’ve developed a list of what increases, versus decreases, the energy we need to produce work that matters.', 'It’s tempting to believe other people’s routines hold the key to success — even when the details border on eccentric.', 'After all, if the 85-year-old Lagerfeld begins his day with Diet Coke and steamed apples, he must be doing something right, right?', 'But even Burkeman admits that he’s unlikely to become a legendary fashion designer by guzzling cans of pop, or by logging a four-mile run at 5 am, like the former PepsiCo CEO, Indra Nooyi.', '“The best defence I can offer,” Burkeman writes, “is that poring over others’ schedules makes me, in a fruitful way, more conscious of my own; experimenting with the tricks I learn is fun, and making daily tasks a little more entertaining surely isn’t a crime.”', 'Becoming more conscious of our own daily rhythms and routines is the true key to success: Understanding what works, and then building on it. Harnessing and protecting our energy. Having the discipline to prioritize essential activities and bypass the rest.', 'That’s when our human curiosity, and a little voyeurism, truly pays off.']
02/2019	It’s Time for Digital Products to Start Empowering Us	We’re accepting utility in exchange for…	17.6K	87	https://medium.com/@hairyelefante	https://medium.com/s/user-friendly/the-future-of-digital-product-design-is-about-human-empowerment-6a025bc330a?source=collection_archive---------8-----------------------	7	0	[]	32	['The digital world, as we’ve designed it, is draining us. The products and services we use are like needy friends: desperate and demanding. Yet we can’t step away. We’re in a codependent relationship. Our products never seem to have enough, and we’re always willing to give a little more. They need our data, files, photos, posts, friends, cars, and houses. They need every second of our attention.', 'We’re willing to give these things to our digital products because the products themselves are so useful. Product designers are experts at delivering utility. They’ve perfected design processes that allow them to improve the way people accomplish tasks. Unfortunately, it’s becoming increasingly clear that utility alone isn’t enough.', 'Quite often, our interactions with these useful products leave us feeling depressed, diminished, and frustrated.', 'We want to feel empowered by technology, and we’ve forgotten that utility does not equal empowerment.', 'Empowerment means becoming more confident, especially in controlling our own lives and asserting our rights. That is not technology’s current paradigm. Instead, digital products demand so much of us and intrude so deeply into our daily existence that they undermine our confidence and control. Our data and activity are mined and used with no compensation or transparency. Our focus is crippled by constant notifications. Our choices are reduced by algorithms that dictate what we see. We can’t even set our devices down because we’ve lost our ability to resist them.', 'In the early years of the web… there was still a degree of separation. We just weren’t on our computers that much. Then the smartphone came along.', 'We brush this off because we’ve confused a sense of utility with a feeling of empowerment. We assure ourselves that we own our lives when we land a great deal on a place to stay, catch the latest update from a friend, discover a great article, or have our groceries delivered. These are just a few of the small moments of pure utility that we’ve learned to confuse with power over our own lives.', 'We’ve been on this trajectory for a while. For decades, companies have taken increased license to insert themselves into our lives. Driven by a combination of proximity and data availability, this trend has reached a crescendo in the last decade.', 'Everything we do on the web now is trackable. Before the internet, this level of data granularity was unfathomable. In the web’s early years, companies began to leverage user insights to target ads and drive their businesses. For a brief time, we had a degree of separation because we just weren’t on our computers very much. Then the smartphone came along.', 'Smartphones have created a once-unimaginable level of proximity between customers and companies. This ever-present connection has dramatically driven up our time spent online. Suddenly, companies can reach us directly anytime, anywhere. Couple that with the growing mountains of data, and the separation between our lives and companies that want to influence them has disappeared.', 'It’s an unsustainable relationship. It may look like the future, but it’s not.', 'Most companies’ current model of value is to design for utility, believing that customers will absolve them of any wrongs done in the name of it. This model is failing because it misses the bigger picture of what humans want from the technology they use.', 'Utility alone won’t assuage us. We want empowerment. We want to be better people. We want technology to enhance our capabilities and increase our sense of agency without dictating the rhythm of our lives.', 'This is the task for the next wave of digital products, and it will require a complete shift in the way we think about design. For starters, we need to be willing to break the existing “utility” mold. As ever, when one company develops a winning strategy, everyone follows suit. Now that we’ve established a set of best practices based on extraction and exploitation, we’ve applied them with cookie-cutter precision across every industry. Companies preach user-centered design, but the products they create often center on the value they receive from the user rather than what they can deliver.', 'As digital product designers, here’s what we need to rethink:', 'Evolving our thinking in each of these areas will be a big step forward, but doing only that isn’t the complete answer. We also need to break our obsession with screen-based solutions. While screens are unlikely to ever go away completely, they’ve become a crutch — the path of least resistance. If there is a problem to be solved, product designers think all they have to do is create an app. Our obsession with designing for screens has fueled an entire industry of UX design boot camps that crank out app designers. We’ve tricked ourselves into believing all problems are nails and screens are the hammer. We’ve got it so dialed in at this point that most apps look the same.', 'Screens are easy.', 'They beget many of the digital product design problems described above. They require attentive processing, meaning our brains must be fully engaged to interact with them. By nature, they demand our attention — which is what encourages the collection of vast amounts of data — and lend themselves to business metrics like minutes viewed, dwell time, page views, and read time. Screens have convinced us that continual engagement is the definition of success.', 'We’ve never wanted to be shackled to technology. It’s not the future we promised ourselves.', 'As long as we continue to design solutions that demand all of our attention, it will be nearly impossible to break out of the “disempowering product” paradigm. Too often, our screen obsession keeps us from even considering the many other creative and powerful ways we could be using the web’s capabilities.', 'Some point to augmented reality as the next phase. While AR may feel transformative and whiz-bang, it’s really just the same screen in a different location. It’s the next step in the race to see how close our notifications can get to our actual eyeballs. It’s not empowering.', 'Empowering products enhance our capability and our sense of agency without disrupting the rhythm of our lives. The car is a great example. It’s a dramatic enhancement to our ability to travel, and we have agency (outside of some basic safety rules) to use it as we see fit. It works with us. It listens to us. It doesn’t disrupt us. A car is there when we need it and invisible when we don’t.', 'This must be our new design mantra: There when you need it, invisible when you don’t. It would be much better than what we believe today: There when you need it, incessantly begging you to come back when you don’t.', 'In his book Enchanted Objects, product designer and entrepreneur David Rose of the MIT Media Lab proposes the concept of “glanceable technology”: products that deliver value without demanding constant attention. Rose’s most basic example is a web-enabled umbrella whose handle glows blue when it’s going to rain so you remember to take it with you. It’s a common device made magical with some basic web intelligence. It’s simple and powerful.', 'Consider another example: a wallet that gets harder to open the closer you get to your budget limit. Contrast that with a flood of “high spending” notifications on your lock screen and in your email from services like Mint. What about an alarm clock that changed color based on the predicted temperature for the day, so you knew how to dress without opening an app? Or a watch that monitors traffic patterns and vibrates to let you know when you need to leave to make it to an appointment on time. A piece of luggage with a handle that glows to notify you if your flight is delayed.', 'Each of these products would enhance our ability to make decisions and manage our lives without disrupting or dictating our actions. They would leverage the power of the web to deliver utility while offering us the agency to use them as we see fit.', 'There is so much depth beyond the screen. Some of the solutions described above might be coupled with an app, but even so, they move us away from screens as our primary entry points to technology. They would put a buffer between us and that needy friend demanding more of our time.', 'This is the future we should be building. It’s not just about “smart” objects. If we continue on our current path, we’ll eventually shove A.I. into every random thing we can find. Intelligence for its own sake does not equal empowerment — just as utility doesn’t. Empowerment comes through execution. If I can text my refrigerator from the store to ask if we have milk before I buy more, I have more agency to manage my life. But if that “smart” refrigerator also tracks my eating habits and funnels them to Amazon so it can spam my phone with “there’s a special on Double Stuf Oreos” notifications, then we’re right back where we started.', 'We’ve never wanted to be shackled to technology. It’s not the future we promised ourselves. Stories from our past don’t depict a future where we all have our heads buried in screens — unless those stories are of the dystopian variety.', 'We’ve always wanted tech to feel like magic, not a burden.', 'We can build the future we want. Technology is not something that happens to us; it’s something we choose to create. When we design the next wave of products, let’s choose to empower.', 'Thanks for reading!

I spent my days extinguishing customer service fires, leaving me little time to focus on growing the business. I was doing so much — and yet I felt like I was spinning my wheels.', 'Once I began hiring an amazing team of engineers and customer service specialists, I was able to focus on my priorities. I delegated customer service issues.

When measuring speed, you can still run in circles, but velocity measures actual progress. We want to focus on velocity, not speed.', 'Building a brand means being relentlessly selective about the opportunities you accept.', 'If you choose and stick to your priorities, you’ll be more productive on a daily basis, too.

Tasks that are neither important nor urgent, are eliminated.', 'Urgency, however, can be a slippery slope. Too often we fall into the trap of hyper-focusing on the time-sensitive.', 'And it’s understandable — we feel instant gratification when we knock out a task, rather than saving it for a later date or taking the time to delegate.

It seemed pointless.', 'Then, in a moment that resembles the unveiling of a Picasso painting for the very first time, I saw the truth: leadership is obtainable. You don’t have to have any experience or be born with a god-like sense of likability.', 'I was always a follower in my career. Then, level two became interesting. Was it really that hard? Could a novice play the game and find the secret to winning?', 'During that Picasso moment, someone I admired told me how they became a leader. It wasn’t what I expected. They became a leader by first understanding this core principle that unlocks everything else about leadership.', 'That core principle is this: leadership is serving others before yourself.', 'This principle was somewhat revolutionary to a kid born in the Kangaroo Country of Australia, mate. If that was at the heart of it all, how many people like me were failing to try level two all because they didn’t know this?', 'My journey of leadership began from here. Now I lead people for a living and also do the same role online as a blogger which has helped me navigate what the basics of leadership are for those who haven’t done it before.', 'Whoever came up with the word ‘leader’ made a mistake. They should have written the meaning of leadership as two words: role model.', 'That’s what a leader is. Your job is to role model the right behaviors.

This is BS.', 'Leaders know that it’s best not to get angry or say something you’ll regret in public. This doesn’t mean leaders don’t get angry too; it’s just that they understand how to control it rather than let it control them.', 'A leaders job is to get people to do stuff.', 'That’s how it was explained to me when I tried to become a school captain in primary school and asked the former school captain for their advice. Getting stuff done is glorified. Many everyday tasks are not as glamorous as putting a human on the moon yet they still need to be done.', 'The way a leader does this is by positioning a goal in a way that is inspiring.', 'That could be something as simple as linking the calling of customers with someone’s career plan to be a championship golfer or using the task of compiling spreadsheets as a step in the process of overcoming a major battle with anxiety.', 'You inspire people by the way you link what they do to what matters to them.', 'You use your own stories that people can relate to and focus on how it helped you, instead of how the world is cruel and messed up.', 'Inspiration is just a pair of glasses you wear.

They create movements and tribes of people who are connected beyond the work itself.', 'They’ve given up standing for nothing and have a few key things they stand for.', 'Shooting your mouth off and talking down to people is disrespectful and successful leaders know that those actions will kill any thriving culture.', 'They prefer to be obsessed with respecting people at all costs. They understand that having people respect them starts with their own ability to respect each person first.', 'This one’s directly related to leadership in business.', 'Successful leaders never threaten someone’s livelihood by attempting to bring their ability to pay their mortgage into the conversation.', 'There are a 101 ways you can pay your mortgage and if a leader uses this as motivation, you can be sure the person they are using it against is stockpiling their savings so they can leave you behind.', 'Successful leaders don’t motivate their people through money or threatening them with being able to put a roof over their head. Instead, they help you to be more successful so you can create more value and maybe pay your mortgage off quicker.', 'We’ve all heard of a leader who demands their team to work long hours. These leaders play games like sending emails at 11:30 at night to see who answers, and the speed of each person’s response.', 'Successful leaders believe in work-life balance and are afraid of their team burning out by working 12-hour days.', 'They want their people spending time with their families, traveling the world and having a healthy reason to come to work each day.', 'They do not want their team becoming tired and frustrated through working long hours because they understand that the work they do, and the relationships they must maintain, will be destroyed in these states.', 'Yes, this sort of thing happens.

What’s next?', 'Final word']	68	['Want to know how to gain customers, boost profits, and save your budget? Among all metrics, there’s a special one that can tell you what value a customer brings to your company during the customer life cycle. Let’s unwrap the customer lifetime value (CLV) metric and make the most of it for your business.', 'Customer lifetime value (CLV, or LTV for “lifetime value”) helps you predict future revenue and measure long-term business success. CLV tells you how much profit your company can expect from a typical client over the course of the relationship. More to the point, CLV helps you estimate how much you should invest in order to retain a customer.', 'Actually, that amount depends on your margins. One company may spend up to $1 to retain a customer while another spends up to $50. To figure out how much you should invest, you need to calculate the customer lifetime value for your business.', 'According to Marketing Metrics, there’s a 5–20% probability that you’ll sell your product or service to a new consumer, whereas the chance of selling it to an existing customer is about 60–70%. Retention is a lot cheaper than acquisition. Thus, successful marketers don’t focus only on strategies for acquiring new customers. They also work out tactics to retain customers and stimulate them to make more purchases. CLV gives an understanding of your promotion spendings, based on which you can further optimize and plan your budget. What’s more, CLV provides useful insights for how to encourage customers to spend more.', 'Knowing the lifetime value of a customer allows you to answer these questions:', 'Let’s see a couple examples of how big companies have adopted CLV results.', 'Back in 2013, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimated that Amazon Primemembers spent $1,340 per year on Amazon, which is twice what non-Prime shoppers spent. Based on this customer lifetime value metric, Amazon started focusing on Prime users and increased the company’s profit over the past four years.', 'Netflix is another good example of why you should learn how to calculate customer lifetime value. In 2007, they found that a typical subscriber stayed with them for 25 months and that CLV was $291.25. This helped them determine that viewers were impatient. After analyzing statistics, Netflix decided to implement online streaming. This kept members satisfied while they waited for new DVDs to arrive in the mail. In this way, Netflix managed to improve retention by 4% and rented its billionth DVD.', 'Likewise, Starbucks shows that by improving customer satisfaction you can increase lifetime value and grow profit. A study by Business Insider shows that Starbucks should spend on acquisition no more than average CLV $14,099.', 'This is how measuring customer lifetime value changes businesses in real life. Ready to give it a go?', 'There are many ways to measure customer lifetime value, and the choice depends on your resources and your business. We’ve picked five noteworthy methods to guide you.', 'The historical approach is based on the gross profit sum from purchases your customers have made in the past. It’s not difficult to do this calculation, since you only need data on previous purchases. There are two methods of calculating CLV using the historical approach: by determining the average revenue per user (ARPU) and using cohort analysis.', 'Let’s suppose 20 customers brought $1,240 in profit over a three-month period.', 'ARPU (3 months) = $1240 / 20 = $62', 'Let’s see what these customers will bring us in one year.', 'ARPU (12 months) = ARPU (3 months) × 4 = $62 × 4 = $248 per year per customer', 'The historical CLV equals the ARPU for one year, which is $248 based on our data. Let’s see what we can do using the other approach.', 'Cohort analysis takes the ARPU approach further. A cohort is a group of customers who have similar characteristics and made their first purchase during the same month in their customer journeys. Using cohort analysis, you calculate the average revenue per cohort instead of per user.', 'Taking the above example, we’ll calculate the ARPU per month for the cohort named Customers from January 2018 that joined in January 2018 and the cohort Customers from March 2018 that joined in March 2018.', 'This table shows that purchases differ from month to month. Suppose your cohorts are not that different. In this case, the March cohort will likely also go silent for some period of time.', 'In addition to calculating CLV, cohort analysis can help you find the number of loyal clients, improve lifetime value by finding the points where purchasing drops off, and accurately assess ad campaign performance. You can read more about this in our article on cohort analysis.', 'These two methods are simple, but they still can’t be used for predictions. The historical approach is valid only if your customers have similar preferences and stay with your company for the same period of time. They don’t consider changes in customer behavior. So if your customers change their interests and the way they purchase, it will affect the outcome.', 'This approach aims to model a customer’s transactional behavior and predict what they’re likely to do in the future. It’s more precise than historical CLV because it applies algorithms that can predict the total value of a customer. Along with past purchases, this approach accounts for a customer’s actions. Again, there are many ways to calculate predictive CLV. Below, we review the simplest equation.', 'Don’t get dizzy! This is the most complicated but accurate method for calculating CLV. You’ll need to calculate some metrics to plug into this formula:', 'Now we’ll figure out how to calculate the metrics you need to plug into this formula.', 'Period: 6 monthsTotal transactions: 120T = 120 / 6 = 20', '2. AOV is the average value of an order, or the average revenue from each order.', 'Total revenue (November): $12,000Number of orders: 20AOV = $12,000 / 20 = $600', '3. AGM is the average gross margin, which tells you what part of each sale is your actual profit and what part is the cost (expressed as a percentage). We need to perform a two-step calculation to get AGM.', 'Example:', 'Total revenue (November): $12,000Cost of sales: $8,000Gross margin (%) = (($12,000 — $8,000) / $12,000) × 100 = 33%', '2. Let’s take a six-month period to get the average:', 'Total gross margin: 1.64AGV = 1.64 / 6 = 0.27, or 27%', '4. ALT represents the average lifespan of a customer, which tells you how long the average customer has been with your company.', 'To get this figure, use this formula:', 'To measure your churn rate, use this formula:', 'Suppose you had 200 customers at the beginning of November and 150 customers at the end of November.', 'Churn rate (%) = (200–150) / 200 = 50 / 200 = 0.25, or 25%ALT = 1 / 25% = 1 / 0.25 = 4 months', 'Finally, we have all the metrics for our CLV prediction formula:', 'CLV (total) = 20 × $600 × 27% × 4 = $1,296,000', 'Now, we should take into account the total number of existing customers at the end of the latest month, November, which was 150.', 'Predicted CLV = $1,296,000 / 150 = $8,640', 'Although this approach is better than the historical model, you still need to consider that the predictions may be misleading. We’re just guessing the customer lifespan based on monthly data. For a more accurate result, you should adjust CLV to your industry and business strategies.', 'If you don’t have flat yearly sales, you can rely on a traditional CLV formula. It’s possible to consider the discount rate, average gross margin per lifespan of a single customer, and retention rate.', 'The formula is:', 'GML = Gross Margin (%) × Average Total Revenue per Customer', 'Gross margin: 27% ( from the example above)Average total revenue: $900 (from the example above)', 'GML = 0.27 × $900 = $243', '2. R is the monthly retention rate.', 'The retention rate, R, is the percentage of clients who made a repeat purchase over a particular period, compared to the previous period. To calculate your monthly R, you’ll need these numbers:', 'Let’s suppose that in November you had:', 'CE = 250CN = 50CB = 220', 'R = ((250–50) / 220) × 100 = (200 / 220) × 100 = 0.9 × 100 = 90%', '3. D is the discount rate. We’ll take a standard 10% discount rate.', 'Now we have all the figures needed to calculate traditional CLV:', 'CLV = $243 × (0.9 / (1 + 0.1–0.9)) = $243 × (0.9 / 0.2) = $243 × 4.5 = $1,093.50', 'This formula covers all possible changes in revenue during a particular period. In order to take into account inflation, each subsequent year should be adjusted by a discount rate.', 'Many marketers use Google Analytics to keep up with essential data. This service provides a feature that helps you measure the value of clients by engagement and revenue metrics across many sessions for a 90-day acquisition period.', 'The LTV report in Google Analytics can tell you data on users’ behavior at their first stages of interaction with the company based on page views, goals, events, and trends. Basically, you just click the buttons to generate a report and Google Analytics breaks it down for you.', 'Google Analytics is an effective tool for data collection, but calculating CLV requires data on real customers and can’t be done only with web metrics.', 'Is my CLV normal? There’s nothing like “normal” for CLV. Any CLV is normal if your business stays alive. You should concentrate on how to improve this metric at any stage of your business development. And if you want a sign from above, here are some interesting statistics: if your CLV is three times your CAC, everything is going well. If not, you have a lot of things to do to improve the situation.', 'If you think that CLV is a bit difficult, just try hard, calculate it, and reap the rewards in the form of valuable insights for your business.', 'Compare your CLV results with acquisition costs to see if your marketing efforts are profitable:', 'It’s another matter if your CLV is equal to or close to your acquisition costs. This says that your business is spending almost as much on a customer as it gains. This might be a strategy when you want to attract new clients. However, it’s always a warning sign, telling you that your marketing efforts aren’t effective. So think about improving your lifetime value. One way to do that is through customer segments using OWOX BI Pipeline.', 'Customer lifetime value can be interpreted in many ways. This metric helps you find the balance. You can figure out how much to invest in order to retain your existing customers and to acquire new ones.', 'Just to give you an idea of possible benefits of CLV monitoring, take a look at these statistics by Criteo:', 'Of course, there are many important metrics to take into account in order to optimize costs. Simply by calculating lifetime value, you can improve your business in all directions. You’ll get an idea from CLV investigations of how to build customer loyalty and increase sales. If you keep your customers satisfied, they’ll stay longer and continue to purchase from you.', 'Source https://www.owox.com/blog/use-cases/customer-lifetime-value/']

But Hawkins, a psychiatrist and lecturer, theorizes that what we feel on a daily basis is a matter of life and death — at least on the cellular level.', 'Hawkins’ theory is based on his recent finding that all emotions have a specific amount of energy. While Hawkins believes lower-energy emotions like anxiety and shame contribute to cell death, more positive states of mind like peace, joy, love, and reason can actually make us healthier.', 'Powerful as our emotions may be, here’s the good news: we’re not victims of the feelings that negatively affect our lives. Research on neuroplasticity demonstrates that the human brain is more than capable of reorganizing itself.', 'But where do we start? How do we gain control of our emotions — and even leverage them to be stronger leaders and creatives?', 'Learning how to manage our emotions begins with a basic understanding of the brain.', 'Our brains are made up of two primary structures.', 'The limbic system controls our emotions and behavioral responses, triggering a sympathetic nervous system response when we’re under stress. This is part of the fight-or-flight reaction, the brain’s instinctive, physiological way of protecting us when it senses we’re in danger.', 'Have you ever felt nervous before a big presentation? You have the limbic system to thank for your sweaty palms and stomach butterflies. Ever been cut off by a reckless driver on the interstate? Your cheeks grow hot and your heart begins to race because your limbic system senses a threat. In short, the limbic system helps us survive.', 'The prefrontal cortex, on the other hand, is far more evolved. If someone’s ever told you to “use your head,” they’re probably referring to the prefrontal cortex, the conscious part of the brain that allows us to reason, delay gratification, and experience the meaning beneath our emotions.', 'While the limbic system is responsible for keeping us alive, problems can arise when it’s in the driver’s seat for too long:', '“When people are in the grip of fear, anxiety or depression, or chronic stress, they are unable to make realistic assessment[s] of situations,” writes Dave Gray, an author and visual thinking coach. “The prefrontal cortex goes ‘offline.’ Creative thinking and innovation, indeed, all higher-level brain functions, are stifled.”', 'So, how do we find mental balance?', 'If the limbic system is the brain’s accelerator, the prefrontal cortex is like the brakes — helping us slow down, assess the situation, and respond to our emotions appropriately.', 'Learning how to hit the brakes is the premise of emotional regulation, or the ability to control how we respond to our feelings — and an important step toward our personal growth and wellbeing.', 'No one is born with the ability to self-regulate. We see this with babies who can’t fall asleep without being rocked, and toddler meltdowns in the grocery store checkout line. Children communicate through emotions.', 'By the time we’re school-aged, most of us have learned how to temper our emotional responses to difficult situations, whether through positive thinking or distraction.', 'We learn that we can control our emotions, and they don’t control us — a critical facet of our wellbeing. In fact, emotional regulation is a vital part of maturing socially and an important pillar of mental health.', 'But there’s a difference between merely moving past our emotions and actually managing them. While emotional regulation focuses on preventing a negative response, emotional management can help us leverage emotions for personal and professional growth.', 'Harvard Medical School professor and psychologist Susan David calls the practice of managing our emotions by mindfully engaging with them “emotional agility:”', '“Whereas positive thinking and avoidance have overemphasized the role of our thoughts, emotional agility is a skill set that builds on our ability to face our emotions, label them, understand them and then choose to move forward deliberately,” David writes.', '“It is the ability to recognize when you’re feeling stressed, be able to step out of your stress, and then decide how to act in a way that is congruent with your personal values and aligned with your goals.”', 'If emotional regulation is a science, then emotional agility is an art.', 'With the ability to strategically embrace and harness our emotions, we can grow in our creative, communication, and leadership abilities. As social scientist and author Joseph Grenny writes:', '“The ability to recognize, own, and shape your own emotions is the master skill for deepening intimacy with loved ones, magnifying influence in the workplace, and amplifying our ability to turn ideas into results.”', 'Building a startup is inherently emotional.', 'Between the occasional disappointment of slow growth, the frustration of a bug in our software, or even simple office miscommunications, my tendency is often to move on, with a smile on my face. There are bigger things to worry about, and I want my team to see me as positive and resilient.', 'Isn’t that what good leaders do?', 'While staying calm in the face of adversity is part of managing a team, it’s not necessarily the best way to manage emotions. In fact, evidence shows I may be doing myself a disservice by wearing a grin when my pulse is speeding beneath the surface.', 'Burying emotions has an equally risky impact: When we avoid or numb how we feel, our emotions often come back magnified. One study shows that smokers who actively tried not to think about cigarettes ended up dreaming about cigarettes, which led them to smoke more.', 'Numbering our emotions can negatively affect our behavior, but more importantly, it can also limit our potential. To become truly resilient, we first have to experience our emotions. We have to allow ourselves to feel difficult things and experience life’s trials in order to grow stronger and wiser.', 'While it’s tempting to escape uncomfortable emotions by quickly moving on, distracting ourselves, or faking positivity, choosing to dig in and feel them can strengthen and stretch us:', '“Unless we can process, navigate and be comfortable with the full range of our emotions, we won’t learn to be resilient,” writes David. “We must have some practice dealing with those emotions or we will be caught off guard. I believe the strong cultural focus on happiness and thinking positively is actually making us less resilient.”', 'Hiding from our emotions also disconnects us from ourselves. Difficult feelings mirror what we care about most in life, because “emotions like sadness, guilt, grief and anger are beacons for our values,” says David. For example, if you feel frustrated when a colleague arrives late for a meeting, you probably value respect and punctuality.', 'While moving on to the next meeting or email during a moment of anger or disappointment seems like the simpler response, it can be more beneficial to reframe how we feel — to challenge the story our emotions are telling us.', 'When we view our emotions as “negative,” an escape attempt is inevitably around the corner. But reframing how we feel helps us to challenge and take ownership of our emotions', 'Beneath the surface of every feeling is a story. Think about it: in the face of a harsh and uninvited critique, you’re probably frustrated by your co-worker’s lack of tact, but look deeper, and you’re probably threatened by his comments because you wonder if you actually are incompetent.', 'Often, these stories represent core beliefs that took root much earlier in life.', 'To manage the emotions that surface in the heat of the moment, Joseph Grenny recommends exploring your “primal story.” For example, if you feel ashamed when a colleague criticizes you, try to trace back the origin feeling or experience.', 'When was the first time you felt ashamed of yourself?', 'As long as we believe these “primal stories” to be true, Grenny says we’re doomed to be victims of our emotions, which leaves us feeling out of control.', 'But understanding your origin story is the first step to challenging the emotion that comes from it:', '“I’ve become aware of the primal origin of the stories I tell — and learned to challenge the perception that my safety and worth are at risk in these moments,” writes Grenny.', 'Managing our emotions also means simply identifying them. A big emotion without a name can feel overwhelming and unending. But naming our emotions empowers us to be realistic about their impact and find a solution.', 'Psychologist Lisa Feldman Barrett says misinterpreting our emotions can cause us to respond inappropriately — and that’s easy to do, since many emotional sensations feel similar.', 'Rather than describing yourself as sad, which feels vague, try labeling your emotion as “dejected” or “disappointed.”', 'Feldman Barrett refers to this specificity as “emotional granularity,” which can help us more deeply understand our circumstances, or reframe negative emotions to feel less threatening. For example, realizing that you’re disappointed by an investor’s reaction to your presentation probably feels more manageable than a vague sense of sadness.', 'Reframing and naming emotions may not be an escape route for everything we feel, but that’s not the goal in the first place. By skipping past the difficulties our emotions can bring, we miss important opportunities to grow.', 'The aim of emotional agility is to manage, and even leverage, emotions to move forward in our work and our relationships. Because when we can hit the brakes on the emotions that hold us back, we can begin to accelerate toward the things we want the most.']

Generate a large number of niche-relevant interactions:', '6. Charge Money:']	55	"['Building a value-creating repost account is the most accessible way for anyone to earn an income on Instagram.', 'Before I started @pinlord, @potteryforall, and @macramemakers (my Instagram repost accounts), I was someone who barely used Instagram and had limited content creation skills but was passionate about a topic (enamel pins) and was willing to put in the work necessary to build a small business online. Now, I make over $3500 a month and I’ve been earning a living from my accounts for almost 3 years.', 'Creating an Instagram repost account that earns you money isn’t about being good at taking photos, or writing captions, or being “an influencer”. It’s about understanding how a repost account creates value and being willing to put in the work necessary to effectively execute the right strategy over a long period of time.', 'If I can do it, so can you… Here’s how:', 'Technically, a repost account sorts through Instagram hashtags and accounts across Instagram to collect content about a niche topic and post it in one place.', 'Personally, I like to think that a repost account does what a magazine used to do but in the context of Instagram.', 'You gather all of the most interesting/engaging/valuable/new content about a particular topic to attract the largest audience possible interested in that topic and then you charge advertisers money to reach that audience.', 'For example, Better Homes and Gardens Magazine creates content about how to take care of your home and garden to attract readers who want to learn about the topic. After they’ve established a large readership they charge companies who sell home and garden related products to advertise to their readers because by promoting their products in that magazine, they sell products.', 'My @potteryforall account does the same thing. I post the best independent pottery-related content on Instagram to attract users who want to learn more about the best pottery on the platform and find it all easily, on one page. Once I established a large following I began charging pottery sellers to be promoted on my Instagram account because, by being promoted, they are discovered by a new audience who follows their account and buys their ceramics.', 'A repost account creates value by building a page that drives traffic and sales to the accounts it promotes. To make money, that’s what your repost account should do.', 'You create a fast-growing repost account that makes money by executing the following steps:', 'To show you how all of these are applied, I’ll use my repost account @potteryforall as an example.', 'For you to be able to build a fast-growing repost account that makes money it first needs to be focused on a niche that fulfills the following requirements:', 'A) It is a commercially-focused niche: When I say commercially-focused I’m referring to a niche in which there are a large number of creators that are selling something through their Instagram, like pottery, macrame, or enamel pins. Basically, any topic in which creators will make money by selling something when you promote them on your account. If the creators can make money by being reposted on your account, they’ll want to pay for that.', 'For example, in @potteryforall I focus on the independent pottery niche on Instagram. Most of the independent potters I promote sell pieces by driving traffic from Instagram to their website, so by getting traffic on their account, they sell more pottery and make more money.', 'B) You have to be the first (or second) reposter within the niche: To reliably make money from your account you have to have the first or second largest following and engagement within your repost niche (and being the largest mostly depends on how early you start within your niche). Why? Being first typically enables a reposter to establish strong brand recognition and loyalty within creators in that niche before other reposters enter. This recognition usually leads to more tags and follows in comparison to the 3rd or 10th largest reposter and that translates into faster long-term Instagram growth.', 'To know if you’re the first, it’s important that you do research within the niche you’re considering. If you discover that there’s already a repost account that has over 5K followers, you’re not very likely to catch up with them so my suggestion is to discard that niche. They key to success is focusing on a niche that has no (or one really small) established reposters yet. Seriously, this is very important.', 'For example, when I was doing research on the independent pottery niche, I discovered there was only one reposter in the independent pottery niche. They were @love_ceramic and they had 2K followers when I found them. Despite that, I decided to start @potteryforall because I considered I could overtake their audience numbers since they had recently started their account as well (and I thought I knew how to grow an Instagram account faster). I was wrong. Although @potteryforall has over 145K followers at the time I’m writing this article, @love_ceramic has over 165K followers. I never caught up with them and they’re able to charge more for their reposts. The 3rd or 10th largest independent pottery reposters that started after us aren’t able to charge anything close to what we charge, but spend the same (or more) time and energy managing their accounts. Don’t waste your time and energy being the 10th largest reposter in a niche.', 'Once you’ve found the niche for you it’s time to pick the right username. The username is an often-overlooked but essential part of growing a repost account quickly. Here’s how you pick the right one:', 'A) It has to begin with the word that people will type when searching for content in your chosen niche: When someone searches for a topic they are interested in on Instagram, they are likely to go to the Search tab and type in the word that describes the topic of interest. Due to the way that Instagram populates search results, the usernames starting with that word are more likely to be surfaced in the search.', 'For example, if I’m interested in finding independent pottery to buy on Instagram but I have no idea which are the best Instagram accounts or hashtags for that topic, I’ll likely just search for “pottery” first. If my Instagram reposter username starts with the word “pottery” (like @potteryforall does), I’m more likely to be surfaced in the search results in comparison to another account that also has pottery content but doesn’t have the word “pottery” in their username (like @pdblais). Over time, this translates into more people discovering you and more followers.', 'B) It has to be short and memorable: Another subtle element that will make a difference in the long-run is having a username that is short, memorable and doesn’t include any “.” or “_”. You want people to remember your username and be able to spell it easily. Over time, it’ll increase the likelihood of word of mouth and people searching for you just because they remember what your username is. For example, @potteryforall is much easier to remember than @pottery_for_all.', 'Your success as the most influential repost account within your niche depends on your ability to post the photos and videos that get the highest engagement on Instagram within your topic. Engagement is how the Instagram algorithm prioritizes content and is the best indicator of value, so having the highest engagement in comparison to other reposters means that you’ll be surfaced in more explorer pages, home feeds and hashtag feeds. This leads to growth as well as drives more followers and sales to the people you promote, which in turn leads to being able to charge more. Here’s how you execute it:', 'A) Find the most interesting Instagram accounts through your Explorer page, Instagram’s recommended users feature, and niche hashtags: As I mentioned before, the Instagram algorithm surfaces content based on high-engagement, so look at what the algorithm has prioritized through your Explorer page and hashtags to discover the most engaging accounts in your niche. The posts and accounts that already get high-engagement by themselves are the most likely to get high-engagement when you repost them as well.', 'Start your search by going to the Explorer page tab and browse through the posts that are relevant to your niche. For example, I constantly see great independent pottery-related posts on my @potteryforall’s Explorer page. When I find one that catches my eye, I go to the account to see if it’s relevant to me. If it is, I follow it (this will increase the likelihood of them following you back) and then I look through the recommended similar accounts Instagram recommends (see below). They are also likely to be high-engagement and relevant to you. Repeat that process until you run out of new accounts to discover and follow.', 'Another channel that’s great for discovering interesting accounts is the hashtag feeds of the tags that are most relevant to your niche. You can learn how to find niche-relevant hashtags here.', 'For example, I know that the hashtag #contemporaryceramics is very relevant for the type of independent pottery I post on @potteryforall. To find relevant accounts I scroll through the feed of the Top posts (the posts tagged #contemporaryceramics that Instagram categorized as most engaging), look at the accounts that post what I find most interesting, and if they’re relevant, I follow them and look through their recommended similar accounts Instagram recommends, as I did before in the Explorer page.', 'Rinse and repeat.', 'By constantly continuing that process as often as you can, you’ll eventually find more than enough high-engagement, interesting accounts to follow and repost.', 'B) Find and save the most highly-engaged posts from the accounts you will feature: Once you’ve discovered the most interesting accounts, you want to find the most engaging of their posts. These are the photos and videos you want to repost because they are likely to get high-engagement on your page as well.', 'I do it by quickly looking at the “like” numbers of the most recent 9–15 posts and then “saving” the post that got the largest number of likes.', 'Through this process, you’ll build up a library of the most engaging posts within your niche in your Saved photos (see below). Here you’ll be able to easily reference and save everything you’ll repost later on.', 'C) Use Dinsta and/or W3toys to download the high-res version of the photo or videos you’re going to repost: Now that you have a library of high-engagement photos and videos to repost, you can easily download the high-res version of them by finding the post in your browser and then extracting the .jpg file from Dinsta for photos or W3toys for video (this is the file you’ll use to automate your posts through an Instagram scheduler).', 'Not only will they give you the high-res file — which is essential because great quality photos perform better — but you’ll also avoid that pesky little white tab that most repost apps use. Those look horrible and negatively affect your engagement.', 'D) Use a content scheduler to automate your posts every day: Once you have a queue of high-res images you’re going to repost, use an Instagram content scheduler to automate the process of posting and save a bunch of time and energy. To maximize the growth of your account make sure to post once per day (look at the “POSTS” section in this article to understand why), use the most effective niche hashtags and post at the time most of your followers are active on Instagram.', 'I like to use OnlyPult to automate my posting because it allows you to automate the placing of your hashtags in the first comment and that keeps your captions clean (some people don’t like to follow accounts that use a lot of hashtags in the caption).', 'E) Clearly tag and promote the accounts you repost: If you want to make money from your account, the most important element of each post you share is to clearly tag and promote the account you’re featuring, not yourself. Why? The amount of money you can charge for your posts completely depends on the amount of traffic and sales you can drive to the account you’re promoting. If the account you’re featuring isn’t the main focus of your posts, it’ll likely not driving as much traffic to them as it could and that results in having to charge lower advertising prices.', 'To maximize value driven per each of your posts, make sure to photo-tag only the account you are featuring, mention their username in the first line of your caption (people are more likely to read the first sentence of a post vs the 2nd, 3rd or 4th) and include a call to action, encouraging people to go to their account and follow/buy/contact them. Here’s how I execute this on @potteryforall:', 'Starting a repost account is so easy that it’s a certainty that you’ll eventually see other repost accounts pop up in your niche. Making sure that your account grows at a faster pace than these new competitors (meaning that you’ll be able to charge more in the future) depends almost entirely on how differentiated your repost account is. The more clearly differentiated you are, the higher the likelihood of it rapidly growing an organic audience relative to the others.', 'To maximize your differentiation first you have to have the most engaging content (detailed in step 3) and second, have the most visually attractive grid. You can dive deeper into the process of differentiating your grid in this article but overall it depends on how well you can sequence your posts in a layout that looks visually pleasing when people scroll through your grid.', 'In the case of @potteryforall, I do this by posting photos that look similar in groups of three. I never deviate from the format and this creates a distinct visual style in my grid which no other reposter had at the time I started.', 'The more creative you are and the better you’re able to execute your grid, the less likely it is for other repost accounts to be able to replicate your style.', 'At first, even if you’ve picked the right niche, found the right username, and post great content with a visually-differentiated grid, it’ll be very difficult for you to grow fast unless you drive a lot of eyes to your account quickly. The best way to do this is to maximize the number of interactions (likes/comments/follows) you have with people who might be interested in your content. In doing this, they’ll discover your username in their activity feed, check out your account, and if they like it, follow you.', 'The best way to find people who might be interested in your content is by identifying the most relevant content creators and hashtags within your niche and then interacting (liking/commenting/following) with as many of the accounts who follow them.', 'You can execute that by hand or by automating an effective bot that isn’t spammy. Here’s an article that lists the most effective and safest accounts, and here’s one that’ll give you a step-by-step guide on how to automate them in a way that’s effective but not spammy.', 'Let’s be clear, having a lot of followers won’t build you a business; driving sales and traffic to the people you repost will. So until you’re doing that, avoid charging money. Once you are (by properly executing steps 1–5) here’s the best strategy I’ve found when it comes to charging money for reposts.', ""A) Maximize inbound requests for repost by making it easy for people to contact you: The more inbound requests for repost you receive, the more money you’ll be able to make. The problem is, most people don't intuitively know that you’re open to promoting their Instagram accounts so it’s important that you clearly state that in your bio. A simple “DM me for a repost” caption will do:"", 'B) Offer clear and specific deliverables: Once you start receiving DM’s from accounts requesting a feature on your account, your long term viability depends on how professional you are and how well you treat the people you work with. Because of this, it’s important that you offer clear and specific deliverables when charging money. Every account will be different depending on your content but in my case, here are the exact deliverables and process I offer on @potteryforall:', 'C) Make it is easy and safe to pay: Part of being professional is also offering people safe payment options that will protect them in case anything goes wrong. In my case, I prefer to use PayPal. Most people have it, it’s easy to use, it offers buyer protection and you can create your own simple payment website (you can learn how to create your own PayPal payment website here).', 'D) Be kind, friendly, professional and take your business seriously: In addition to driving results, your long term viability as a business will greatly depend on how kind, friendly, and professional you are to work with so take it seriously. Thank people for requesting a repost, be interested in what results they got following your post, ask your customers for feedback, give sincere advice whenever anyone asks, and always try to do the best job you can. Apart from good business, you might just end up helping businesses thrive and making some great friends along the way.', 'E) Continue to change and test in order to keep delivering results: Last but not least, remember that how much money you can charge depends on how much traffic and sales you can drive so optimizing your account for high engagement should always be your priority. Continually measure your engagement, test new content and, evolve your business. If you’re doing well in your niche, it’s inevitable that other repost accounts will pop up, therefore being the most differentiated and effective at driving results is the only guarantee you have to continue a healthy business.', 'And that’s it, folks…', 'To create a successful Instagram repost account that makes you money you have to find the right niche, the right username, post the most engaging content within your niche once a day, craft a highly-differentiated account, and generate a large number of niche-relevant interactions to build an audience that grows fast as well as drives traffic and sales whenever you feature someone. Once you’re driving traffic and sales, you can begin to start charging money as well as continue to improve and optimize in order to build a long term business. And if you’re wondering if this actually works, check out @bonsaibooth and @stikerfreaks on Instagram. It was started by someone in Japan who read my articles and decided to use the same techniques.', 'By the way, if you want to dive deeper into other strategies and systems to grow your Instagram faster, read these articles on what Instagram really is and how works, Instagram niches and why they are the key to growth, how to make money on Instagram, everything you need to know about TikTok Bots, why your Instagram account isn’t growing, how to pick the right Instagram username, Instagram bots 2021, how to create effective Instagram story ads, how to create effective Instagram sponsored posts, how to check if you’re shadowbanned, how to monetize your Medium article, how to increase your Instagram engagement rate, how to find the best times to post, as well as how to find the most valuable Instagram influencers, how to measure what an influencer is worth, how to measure your influencer marketing ROI, and how to reach out to influencers.', 'I hope this helps! And don’t forget, the best way to build something is just to get started. Don’t let questions or analyzing stop you. I was terrible at content creation before starting my repost accounts and now I make a living from them. If I can do it, so can you!']"

On October 31, 2008, someone under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto published a whitepaper on a cryptography mailing list. That event changed the history of money and left us all wondering about the mastermind behind it.', 'Over the years, many journalists and bloggers have tried to unveil the shadow cast on the creator of bitcoin without much luck. There have been a lot of candidates, some of them even self-nominated. However, none have given definitive proof of their claims, so we are still searching for the person behind the mystery.', 'There is, though, one stand-out candidate. I had to guess, I would say with great certainty that he is the creator of bitcoin. Before I tell you who I’ve chosen, let’s assess what we know about Satoshi Nakamoto. Or, better yet, what he wants us to know.', 'In Satoshi’s P2P Foundation profile, he claims to be a man from Japan, born on April 5, 1975. The problem is that he doesn’t behave or sound like someone from Japan. First of all, he wrote the whitepaper and his subsequent posts in perfect English. Secondly, his sleep pattern is very strange for someone living in Japan.', 'Bitcoin Forum member Stefan Thomas graphed the time stamps from more than 500 of Satoshi’s posts. He found that Satoshi Nakamoto never posted anything between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. Japanese time. So, it’s possible — probable, even — that Satoshi’s entire identity is fictional.', 'But why would he pretend to be someone else?', 'Just like there was Pretty Good Privacy, a project that enabled people to send encrypted messages to each other. Phil Zimmermann, an activist who wanted to give dissidents a government-free communication channel, founded PGP. However, the USA government realized the potential of this technology and confiscated it. PGP and Zimmermann then become the subjects of a criminal investigation.', 'The only thing this technology did was enable two individuals to communicate without being eavesdropped on. So, imagine how the government would treat the creator of bitcoin, a technology that enables free money transfers without banks or intermediaries. The technology that takes money out of the hands of the government.', 'Now that I’ve covered my misgivings about his identity and reasons for hiding it, here’s what we know about Satoshi Nakamoto.', 'As I’ve already mentioned, Satoshi Nakamoto emerged with a whitepaper on cryptography mailing list metzdowd.com. His nine-page document proposed “a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party” on Halloween 2008.', 'He then created the bitcointalk forum and posted the first message under the pseudonym satoshi. He also made a website with the domain name bitcoin.org and continued to work on bitcoin software. On January 3, 2009, Satoshi mined the first Bitcoin block, known as the “genesis block”.', 'Throughout 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto collaborated with other developers to modify the bitcoin protocol. He was involved in the bitcoin community and corresponded with them frequently. Then, all of a sudden, he gave the keys and codes to Gavin Andresen and transferred domains to members of the community. By the end of 2010, he had stopped working on the project.', 'Then, on Saturday April 23, 2011, the creator of bitcoin emerged once again to post his last message. When developer Mike Hearn asked him if he planned to rejoin the community, Satoshi replied:', 'I’ve moved on to other things. It’s in good hands with Gavin and everyone.', 'The man who had disrupted the financial system for good simply disappeared. But why then?', 'We should also take into account that Satoshi’s bitcoin addresses had — and still contain — about 1,000,000 BTC. In December 2017, when the price peaked, he had more than US$19 billion. For that short moment, Nakamoto was 44th richest person in the world! And to this day he hasn’t cashed a single bitcoin.', 'All this evidence suggests that something may have happened to creator of bitcoin. That is why I believe Hal Finney is Satoshi Nakamoto.', 'Unfortunately, Hal Finney was diagnosed with ALS in 2009 and fought the disease until his death in 2014. I imagine he created the future of money, but then had to retreat when the disease progressed. And then he died and left us with only rumors about the true identity of the creator of bitcoin.', 'He could not claim his throne.', 'Hal Finney was a computer scientist who graduated from Caltech in 1979. As a student, he received the “most brains” award from his peers. During his freshman year, he took a course on gravitational field theory designed for graduate students. It seems Finney was extremely intelligent, which fits the first criterion for being Satoshi Nakamoto.', 'Students also remember seeing Finney with a copy of Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged. If he was reading this kind of literature, he could have easily formed libertarian views on life.', 'And he did. His views pushed him towards a little-known group of free thinkers and coders. In the early 1990s, he became a member of Cypherpunks. This movement was dedicated to the “widespread use of strong cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies as a route to social and political change.” They were self-proclaimed defenders of privacy and Finney put his knowledge at their disposal to achieve the cryptoanarchist vision.', 'When someone wrote on Cypherpunk’s mailing list about the above-mentioned Phil Zimmermann and his idea for PGP, Hal responded. He contacted Phil and became the first employee of PGP Corporation, working there until his retirement in 2011. That same year, Satoshi Nakamoto stopped his involvement with bitcoin.', 'Finney made a significant contribution to the new version of the PGP protocol, but he had to hide his involvement from the government. So he was very well aware of the problems Phil had regarding PGP. Because of that, I can understand his desire to hide his identity when creating bitcoin.', 'Well, his fictional character was much closer than it might appear. Less than two miles from his house lived another scientist named Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto. It is possible that Finney took Nakamoto’s identity to conceal his own. I mean, what are the odds that both of them lived in Temple City, a small town with just 36,000 people? One cryptographic genius and another named exactly like the creator of bitcoin: too big a coincidence?', 'After posting the whitepaper on the mailing list, Satoshi Nakamoto received three replies. Two of them were negative. However, the third answer was very much affirmative, and it boosted the acceptance of bitcoin. Guess who posted that message? You’re right, it was Hal Finney.', 'The message was:', 'This does seem to be a very promising and original idea, and I am looking forward to seeing how the concept is further developed.', 'He even encouraged Satoshi to write the code, thinking others would be convinced once they saw the network running.', 'The rest of the story goes like this: When the code was done and the program ready for testing, it was Hal who received the first version. On January 10, 2009, he downloaded the code and connected to the bitcoin network. His computer was the first to connect to Satoshi’s network.', 'Two days later, Hal received 10 BTC from Satoshi Nakamoto. It was the first Bitcoin transaction between two computers. To me, it’s very interesting that Hal was always involved in bitcoin’s biggest moments.', 'I think Hal Finney was behind Satoshi’s account and he sent messages to himself.', 'I know, it does seem far-fetched. However, if you’re deliberately trying to hide your contribution to the project, this is the way to do it. He faked those messages and sent the first bitcoins to himself to test the transaction system. That is why he never paid them back.', 'Not to mention that, according to Wikipedia, Hal Finney created the first reusable proof-of-work system. As you know, this is the protocol on which bitcoin is based. Furthermore, Finney was fascinated with the idea of digital money from the 1990s. In 1993, he even created his own currency called CRASH, derived from CRypto cASH.', 'Before that, David Chaum invented anonymous electronic money called DigiCash. One bank in the USA started to experiment with it and Hal immediately opened an account there. The problem was that Chaum’s version was centralized, and when his company collapsed, so did DigiCash. Finney wasn’t very amused by this, so he started to think of the ways to make currency decentralized. Just like bitcoin.', 'Of course, this isn’t the first time someone has identified Hal Finney as the creator of bitcoin. Forbes journalist Andy Greenberg even went to his house and asked if he was the real Satoshi Nakamoto. Hal categorically denied the claim. As evidence, his son Jason showed the conversation between Hal and Satoshi from 2009. He also denied knowing Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto, his neighbor from Temple City.', 'I assume he simply wished to spend his last days with his family. Since he was essentially paralyzed, he did not wish to be disturbed by a media circus. And the media wasn’t the only problem. Someone tried to extort 1,000 BTC from him shortly before his death. Imagine what that criminals would have done if they’d known he was the real Satoshi Nakamoto. And let’s not even think about what the government would have done to him.', 'So, he decided to lay low. And it was for the best. Satoshi’s anonymity increases the level of faith in the system. He gave the world something extraordinary, a legacy that he could be proud of. If bitcoin succeeds, it’s going to shift power from governments and corporations to the hands of individuals.', 'In the technological era, when our privacy is compromised, bitcoin is something to be hopeful for. The mystery behind its creator leaves room for our imagination; everyone can project their own vision onto bitcoin.', 'Although his work has outlived him, we should not forget Hal Finney and his legacy to mankind. Even if I am wrong, and he isn’t the real Satoshi Nakamoto, we should always remember the contribution he had made to bitcoin. He was a worthy soldier in our fight for a better tomorrow.']

By getting comfortable doing nothing at all, we can free our minds up to focus on higher priorities — and increase our likelihood of arriving on time.', 'Experts have also found that certain people tend to move through the day in a more intuitive way, rather than feeling controlled by the clock. Robert Levine, a professor of social psychology at California State University, calls this “event time.”', 'According to Levine, those who live by event time allow events to dictate the rhythm of their days. Projects are finished when they feel done; meetings are over when the discussion has run its course.', 'And though people can function in both modes, most of us have a default — which is likely an inborn trait.', 'At JotForm, I’ve found that many employees work best when they’re free to function in an intuitive mode, or on event time. They’re more productive when they can get into deep flow, and they’re not racing against the clock.', 'While serving as liaison to a former governor in Iraq, Sandi Austin quickly realized a stark cultural difference.', '“After planning numerous events and spending many hours waiting and waiting at the gate, I finally realized that time, schedules, and punctuality have no leash on Iraqi culture,” she explained in a story for the New York Times.', '“People there are not apologetic when they arrive late because time is not as important to them. The fact that they show up at all and God allowed them to travel safely is all that matters.”', 'Though she initially struggled to acclimate, Austin learned to not take offense at her Iraqi counterparts’ tardiness. She even began to appreciate their tendency to focus less on time and more on living in the moment.', 'Different cultures have unique approaches to scheduling. In some countries, people don’t sweat the time and showing up late is no big deal.', 'For example, in Mexico, it’s acceptable to arrive up to half an hour late. Nigerians allow each other an hour window from the agreed upon time. And in Morocco, you can be an entire day late without causing offense.', 'On the other side of the spectrum are nations like Germany, Japan, South Korea, and my home country, Turkey. In these countries, you’re expected to call if you’re running behind, and failing to do so is considered rude.', 'It’s important to keep these differences in mind when working with foreign colleagues or companies. I’m lucky that JotForm has offices in two countries with similar attitudes toward timeliness (the United States and Turkey), so interoffice video conferences generally start on the dot.', 'But that’s not always the case, and being aware of these differences can help us to avoid misunderstandings.', 'Age differences can also contribute to varying perspectives on scheduling. Sometimes, when I chat with older colleagues, they’re shocked to hear that some of our younger employees arrive to the office at 10 am or later — and I’m fine with it.', 'As I’ve learned in the last 13 years, it’s not because our millennial employees are working less, or because they don’t care. It’s because they’re often answering emails from home at 8 in the morning; or because they’re at the office during their peak hours — late at night.', 'Younger generations value flexibility at work. A recent FlexJobs survey asked 3,000 millennials to choose the most important factors when evaluating a job prospect. Among the top five factors were work-life balance (84 percent), work flexibility (82 percent), and work schedule (65 percent).', 'Millennials want jobs that offer flexibility, even if that means taking a pay cut.', 'For many of them, flexibility means they don’t have to follow an arbitrary 9-to-5 schedule, and can work based on when, where, and how they’re most productive: whether that means working late nights or from a coffee shop.', 'With that in mind, it’s important for managers to accommodate different scheduling approaches, while offering support to the chronically tardy among us.', 'Assuming you’re not dealing with someone who enjoys making others wait — Diana DeLonzor, author of “Never Be Late Again,” refers to this type of tardy person as the “Rebel” — here are some tips for remedying chronic lateness. Or, if you’re the colleague who’s always running behind, hopefully they can improve your own punctuality.', 'The first step is to identify the cause of the tardiness. Maybe you, like Georgia Francis King, are a multitasker who is always overbooked.', 'Jeff Conte, an associate psychology professor at San Diego State University, found that multitaskers tend to perceive time more slowly. These people are often so engrossed in what they’re doing that they frequently lose track of time.', 'DeLonzor identifies other categories of late-goers, including: the “Evader,” who struggles to leave an existing task until it’s perfect; the “Indulger,” who lacks self-control; and the “Deadliner,” who likes the thrill of a last-minute rush.', 'Whatever the root cause may be, even something as benign as enjoying a deadline-driven adrenaline rush, it’s not working out — and you’re wasting other people’s valuable time. The only solution is to correct the relevant behavior.', 'So, if you lack the discipline to be punctual, set a calendar alert (or three) the moment an appointment is scheduled. If you’re a chronic multitasker, get in the habit of leaving open time windows between tasks, and use them to sit with your thoughts.', 'At the same time, I think it’s important to embrace each person’s innate scheduling style so they can do their best work.', 'That’s why at JotForm, most of us maintain a “hybrid” calendar, which accommodates both the inevitable clock-time meetings, as well as large swaths of time for uninterrupted, clock-free creative work.', 'And I encourage our employees to automate as much as possible — weekly emails, meeting alerts, reports — to minimize the possibility of missing a deadline.', 'If one of your colleagues continues to show up late, try explaining the consequences, not in terms of minutes or hours, but rather, in terms of the impact on others.', 'For example:', 'You were late, and as a result, Andy had to take the lead in our client meeting and struggled to explain our proposal to them.', 'Once you diagnose the problem, you can create an action plan that matches the root issue.', 'I think we can all agree that it’s frustrating when someone makes us wait. But before we jump to conclusions about our friend or colleague’s lack of respect, it’s important to recognize that there are various reasons for tardiness. Often, it comes down to personality traits, cultural norms, or generational differences.', 'For younger generations, workplace flexibility is increasingly important. That’s why companies are better off when managers and employees try to support, rather than feel insulted by, colleagues who don’t function on clock-time.', 'Plus, you’ll likely feel better when you give your late friend the benefit of the doubt.']

I’ll show you the best ways I’ve learned to learn new skills, all in this article.', 'A lot of us learn a bunch of new skills on a regular basis, without thinking much about it. Learning a new skill is very much an activity our brain does “without our consent”.', 'In this article, I won’t go into the scientific details on what happens in your brain and where. I’ll use common terms like “brain” and “memory”, to make this more accessible for everyone to read.', 'Ultimately, what a skill really is is a series of connections in your brain. As you practice a set of actions, your brain creates these connections for you.', 'While that may seem like great news, that’s not always the case. The brain doesn’t discern what is good and what is bad for you. That’s how bad habits get created. It just records your actions and stores it in your memory.', 'It’s also the reason why we think that new skills are hard to learn: we don’t make the right connections in our brains. We don’t do the right actions that make the learning of a new skill easier.', 'As such, I really want to put emphasis on a word I used in my first sentence above: “deliberate”.', 'When you deliberately focus your efforts on doing the right actions to learn something new, you direct your brain to create the connections you want it to make.', 'And that’s powerful.', 'This article won’t be focusing on any specific skill except for the skill of learning how to learn. The principles you will learn in this guide will apply to any skills you want to learn, from motor skills to intellectual skills.', 'It will also teach you the reason why it’s so important to diversify your skill set, especially in this century.', 'This guide you’re about to read is the culmination of the 100+ articles I have written on the subject, the learnings I’ve made through my own experimentations, the books I’ve read, the courses I’ve completed, the data I’ve collected from the SkillUp program, and the data I’ve collected from various expert sources.', 'It’s the ultimate guide to help you on your journey to skill development.', 'Are you pumped?', 'I know I am!', 'Here’s my favourite definition:', 'The ability to do something well', 'Simple and to the point.

What is the skill of writing then? It is the combination of the following skills, and then some:', 'A skilled writer will have proficiency in all of the above skills and more. In writing, and in as many other skills, it helps to have knowledge in other fields to actually have content to write about.', 'The above list holds the key to some learning to learn principles we’ll talk about a little further below.', 'But do the exercise, if not now, then shortly after, of thinking of a skill and breaking it down into its smallest components. It’s the kind of exercise that will teach you the habit of thinking smaller for your bigger thoughts, ultimately motivating you to achieve your ambitious goals. Refer to the section on building SkillUp Trees to push that even further.', '*Refer to Appendix A at the end for examples of skills I have learned in 15–20 hours of practice.', 'When I started my SkillUp method (learning 3 new skills every month, practicing for 30 minutes each every day), I had two reasons for wanting to learn new skills:', 'These are perfectly valid reasons and likely to be the most common ones.', 'What I found through learning so many skills in such a short amount of time is that there are many more benefits I hadn’t originally thought about. And the following results have been observed by Michael Simmons with his 5-hour rule, which isn’t that different from the SkillUp method.', 'The following list is not necessarily in order; however, all these benefits are incredibly important.', 'Surprisingly, I didn’t expect this at all but it makes so much sense in retrospect. When you learn a diverse set of skills, you broaden your knowledge.', 'No longer can I just have deep conversations with software engineers (my main profession). I’m now more relatable in many other areas. I’ve made friends because I knew about eCommerce, video editing, photography, drawing/art, Spanish conversations, music composition, web development, and more.', 'I used to be a shy & introverted guy who had a hard time fitting in when I was not around engineers or game developers.', 'How that has changed in the past 14 months!', 'After all, when is making deeper personal and professional connections a bad thing?', 'Don’t we all want deeper connections?', 'Another surprising fact for me, which again completely makes sense in hindsight, is that the more you learn, the faster you learn. I’ll go deeper into that in the next section as this is a key to learning how to learn.', 'Just to give an easy example: isn’t it true that once you know a romance language, it’s easier to learn the others. Being a native French speaker, it’s much easier for me to learn Spanish than it is for an English speaker, simply because it comes from the same root, Latin.', 'Don’t we all want to learn faster?', 'A lot of the reasoning behind this fact is that when you consistently practice a skill, inevitably, you progress.', 'And progress = win.', 'The more wins you get, the more dopamine your brain produces. Without going into details, dopamine is a key factor to life satisfaction. The more satisfied you are, the more motivated you are.', 'By practicing three skills every morning, on average, I get three wins right at the start of my day.

It’s simple, I’m really passionate about this stuff!', 'Don’t you have more energy when you do things that you like doing?', 'Skill development can be a lot of fun. I never thought I’d ever love Salsa Dancing, but it turns out it just might be the most fun skill I’ve ever practiced. Knowing that I have a class every morning gives me so much energy.', 'And when I finish it each morning and think about the progression I have made since day one, I get pumped.', 'If you learn a skill out of necessity, don’t neglect the fun aspect to it.

The second one is closer to reality and probably the most widely accepted, but it’s also wrong. This is just a perception of our learning and is actually quite demoralizing, because the reality is more like this:', 'You’ll reach what people call “plateaus” on a regular basis during your skill development process. Most people stop around that time, thinking that they’ve reached their limit.', 'The truth is, limits are all in our heads. We can do so much more than we think we can. We see the limits pushed all the time in sports or athletics. Once someone beats a record, suddenly “everyone” can reach that “limit”, pushing it further than ever before.', 'Remember, everyone thought the 4-minute mile was impossible, but Roger Bannister proved them wrong, and opened the door for 26 more people to do it soon after.', 'Let’s now dig deeper into the steps to learn new skills in under 20 hours:', 'When you went to school when you were younger, you were fed with answers. You were told an exact way in which you should be learning a concept. Out of school, we don’t think much on how we learn new things. We search for online videos and hope for the best.', 'This is NOT the best way to learn. Heck, it wasn’t even the best way in school!', 'The best way to learn any skill is never the best way for everyone.', 'The best way to learn a new skill is to figure out how the skill can be learned from your previous set of skills. More on that in section #2. Build SkillUp Trees.', 'Before jumping on your next course and hope that you’ll learn a skill from there, take time to craft a learning plan. Think about the following:', 'Don’t limit yourself to these questions. Think of other questions on your own. Personalize your learning based on your strengths and weaknesses. Be realistic and scale a skill down as needed.', 'In a previous article, I went into details about the SkillUp Tree principle. It’s a powerful method to be more aware of what your current skillset is and how to move forward from there.', 'To learn any new skill in under 20 hours, you have to know what you’re currently capable of and analyze what you should learn next. It’s unrealistic to think that you can learn portrait photography in 15 hours if you’ve never picked up a camera before.', 'Let’s use this very simple skill idea to illustrate the concept:', 'From the Walking branch, we can branch further to the following branches:', 'It is impossible for you to learn the “Running” skill if you don’t know the “Walking” skill.', 'Once you’re aware of what is required to learn a new skill and have a clear vision of how to learn it, it’s time to put everything into practice. I can’t stress the importance of consistency enough here. In learning anything, the more you practice, the easier it gets and the more connections your brain will make.', 'There is no shortcut. To learn a new skill, you can’t avoid deliberate consistent practice.', 'Execute your plan from Step 1 for a week. Reflect on your learnings; what went right and what went wrong. Adjust as needed. Always measure how well your practice session went. As needed, use a tool like the SkillUp Journal to record and measure your progress.', 'Add some accountability to help you follow through. Share your progress with your entourage or online. Join like-minded groups of skill learners and compare progress. Remember, the first time you’re going to do anything in life, you’ll be bad at it, and that’s normal. It’s the people who pick themselves up after their “failures” who learn best.', 'As needed, update your SkillUp Tree when progress has been made. It’s incredibly rewarding to visually see how your learning has progressed.', 'Whatever you do, don’t stop when it hurts. That’s when the learning truly happens.', 'In this section, we’ll touch on Memory and how, as you might imagine, it plays a very important role in learning.', '1. Creating long term memories', 'It is common knowledge that we have two memory “systems”: the short term memory (or working memory) and the long term memory. Without going too scientific on you, the short term memories happen mostly in the pre-frontal lobe:', 'And long-term memories are stored in the hippocampus:', '“Memories” always start as a short term memory, and in order to consider something acquired, it has to go from short term to long term memory.', 'But how do we make that happen? It turns out there are many ways, but here’s an image that sums it up:', 'To simplify things: short term memories become long term memories by recollection. The more you expose your brain to a piece of information, the more complete the information will start to form in the hippocampus, where long term memories are stored.', 'Once information is stored in your long term memory, it can still change, but not as easily. More on that in section #7. Neuroplasticity.', 'Knowing that, it’s never a bad idea to “reactivate” a memory “frequently”. You’ve probably seen that in action when doing a skill you haven’t done for a while, like riding a bicycle, or playing a sport or an instrument.', 'You still remember the techniques, but you’re a little “rusty”. After a few minutes, it’s as if you never stopped doing it.', 'That’s what reactivation is all about.', 'What happens then in your brain is it resends the “newly found” information and sends it back to the long term memory to reinforce the knowledge. If you ride your bicycle the next day, you won’t be “rusty” again.', '2. Remembering Techniques', 'Refer to the following table for seven powerful remembering techniques:', 'Resources:', '3. Note Taking', 'Having trouble remembering the techniques above?', 'It takes a lot of practice, but once you’re good at them, you can greatly increase you ability to memorize things.', 'An easy technique, that everyone knows about, but not enough people apply is note taking when reading or watching videos. And by note taking, I don’t mean highlighting. In fact, according to Dr. Barbara Oakley, highlighting can be detrimental to your learning.', 'Have you noticed when you take notes of things to reference later, you tend to actually remember it without ever needing to reference it?', 'Without going too deep into the scientific details of why that is, you are making a conscious effort to recall it by writing it down. As mentioned above, it uses a few of your senses to create the memory.', 'Want to greatly improve your memory in a short period of time?', 'Take notes when you read and watch videos as it greatly improves your recollection by handwriting your notes.', '4. Recollection', 'This is the most important aspect of creating long term memories and something almost everyone does wrong.', 'When and where should you revisit material you’re trying to remember?', 'Where', 'It turns out that most of us don’t do it the right way. Most people “study” material from the same exact environment; in the living room or in the study for example. The problem is that the brain stores the setting of the learning as a reference point to recall a memory.', 'Have you noticed how, as a student, you had a hard time recalling information during an exam?', 'One of the possible causes of this is you only studied in one environment. Successful students often diversify their environments of study: in their bedroom, their living room, at a café with other students, in the classroom, at the library, with music, without music, in a cold room, in a hot room, etc.', 'The more you vary your environment when trying to learn a new concept, the more deeper connections you’ll make in your brain, creating stronger long term memories.', 'If you practice rock-climbing / bouldering at the same gym, at the same time with the same people, do you think you’ll learn better than someone who varies the gym they go to, the people they go with, the indoor/outdoor settings, etc?', 'No, right?', 'The best athletes train for different scenarios. Same with the military. So whatever it is you are trying to learn, make it your mission to vary your study environment!', 'When', 'Now, let’s attack the “When”.', 'Have you ever revisited the same material over the course of a few days, hoping that it would “stick”, just to realize it doesn’t get to your head?', 'Right. Your brain doesn’t work that way.', 'Have you also noticed how when you study just before an exam, your recollection is pretty good, but a few days later, you’ve basically forgotten everything you have “learned”?', 'Right. Your brain doesn’t work that way either.', 'In both scenarios, you’ve learned nothing, or close to it.', 'So when should we practice recollection then?', 'Spaced Repetition is what you’re looking for. Here’s an image that summarizes it really well:', 'If you have used language learning apps like Duolingo or Memrise, you may have noticed how they’re doing that for you behind the scenes. It’s no surprise then that these two apps have shown some of the best results for learning a new language.', 'If you’re learning a new guitar chord today, recall it 24 hours later, then 7 days later, then a month later, then a year later. You’ll “forever” remember it.', 'It works the same for every skill you want to learn. Never “fire and forget”. Put it in your calendar.', '5. Forgetting', 'Forgetting, it turns out, is one of the most important aspects to learning. There are at least two reasons why forgetting or unlearning is useful.', 'First, during your learning phase of anything, you’re unsure of the information you’re digesting. You accumulate information without knowing how to make sense of it. This knowledge then becomes useless once you make the right connections. If you don’t unlearn it, your brain will refer to it again and confuse what is “true” and what isn’t.', 'Second, forgetting your experience is essential to being able to transfer skills from one job to another.', '“Our work shows that an unstable memory is a key component of the mechanism for learning transfer. An unstable memory prevents learning from being rigidly linked to one task; instead, it allows learning to be applied flexibly.” — Professor Edwin Robertson', 'In summary, forgetting the context in which you learned something helps apply the learnings in a variety of other concepts.', '6. Sleep', 'Connections made in your brain happen subconsciously, that is, when you’re not actively practicing what you learn. While activities like jogging, meditating, and taking a shower help with the assimilation of information, sleeping is shown to provide even better results.', 'It is not a coincidence we’re all familiar with the saying: “Let me sleep on this.”', 'During sleep, our body rejects bad toxins accumulated and subconsciously “work on” the material we have fed it before going to bed. If there’s a concept you’d really like to grasp but can’t seem to during the day, try before going to bed. Chances are, you’ll have a deeper understanding the next day.', 'That being said, during the day, if you’re too tired to make sense of a problem you’re trying to solve, power naps are a great way to achieve the results mentioned above.', 'Einstein, Dali, Edison, and many others used this technique to get to their “Aha!” moments.', 'Moreover, a well-rested body and mind is more receptive to the different stimuli around, making easier to make sense of the information coming through your brain.', '7. Neuroplasticity', 'Neuroplasticity, also called brain plasticity, is the process in which your brain’s neural synapses and pathways are altered as an effect of environmental, behavioral, and neural changes. — study.com', 'Neuroplasticity is a way for your brain to fine-tune itself for efficiency.', 'For example, if someone suffers a brain injury, neuroplasticity allows the brain to ‘rewire’ itself in order to restore, or maximize brain functioning by rebuilding neural circuits and allowing an uninjured part of the brain to take over the damaged part.', 'To better understand neuroplasticity, refer to the following inforgraphics:', 'One of the biggest criticism I get about the SkillUp method is about mastery.', '“Jack of all trades, master of none.”', 'I disagree that it’s such a bad thing. It’s also not necessarily true that a polymath is a master of none. A polymath, in fact, is a master of some.', 'While it’s true that with 15 hours of deliberate practice, you won’t master anything (unless you’re the greatest genius to ever live — and who will ever live).', 'What some people fail to realize is that the SkillUp method is an ongoing process.', 'Remember when I said that the more you learn, the faster you learn?', 'As we previously learned, it’s true because of the mental chunks we create in our brains that allow us to make connections faster thanks to our growing collection of chunks.', 'Knowing this, the more you learn, the faster it is to master something. Not-so-strangely enough then, learning to play the piano, the guitar, the violin and the tuba at the same time actually improves your mastery of each of those individually.', 'Given all these facts, over the period of a few years, you wouldn’t be a master of none but rather a master of some. And that mastery of some is inevitably, based on science, going to be faster if you learn the skills concurrently as opposed to separately.', 'That was a great question I got from SkillUp member, Joshua Galinato.', 'Where is the balance between under-learning and over-learning?', 'In truth, it really depends on one’s intention. If it’s for a profession, then I’d argue you should never stop learning and aim to go from good to great.', 'When setting out to learn a new skill, be specific. Learn subsets of skills. Or subsets of subsets. Let’s say mini-skills or bite-sized skills. The only way to know when to stop is to know what it means to have mastered or close-to-mastered the mini-skill.', 'I personally aim for mini-skills and give myself about a month to be good in it, practicing 30 minutes a day. Basically, the core of The SkillUp method. But there’s really no wrong answer here. If a mini-skill takes 5 hours, then so be it!', 'While I rarely do direct follow-ups of the skills I have learned during the given month, I always end up using what I’ve learned one way or another. When a few months later I want to learn a new skill that uses a previously learned mini-skill, my learning drastically accelerates.', 'The SkillUp method really has three different choices when it comes to the end of your 15 hours practice:', 'You can always improve anything you are doing. Take advantage of the momentum and accelerate your learning even more. Try to become a “master” at it.', 'For example, Erik Hamre always pushes to 100 hours and becomes really good at each skill he learns.', '2. Find a complementary skill; or', 'Take advantage of the momentum to learn something complementary. Focus on a more specific subset of a particular skill, or a different branch. Learn a new language tense or vocabulary, learn new Photoshop techniques, learn new Machine Learning principles, etc.', '3. Do something else entirely.', 'Some say that to find success, you must focus on a particular set of skills. I personally challenge this “rule”. I like diversity. I like to be adaptable. I like to relate to other people’s stories. I feel like I’m a better person for it.', 'Doing something else entirely breaks the momentum for that skill, but the success you acquired from learning previous skills should carry over and keep you motivated. Your brain will now accept that you can indeed learn things you never knew you could.', 'Critical question!', 'Too many people read articles or books, follow online course, watch YouTube videos, only to do nothing about it. Only 7% of people who start an online course finish it. That’s a lot of missed opportunities.', 'Let me do just a quick re-iteration why skill development matters:', 'You brain doesn’t make the connections if you don’t practice. I suggest you bookmark the guide and refer to it frequently. It’s a lot to swallow on a single read and I don’t expect you to remember it all right away!', 'Today or this week, but no later, list the skills you’d like to learn. Find resources on the subject. Create a model in your mind on what results you expect out of 15 hours of practice. Be realistic. Work backwards from your envisioned results. What are the baby steps required to get there? Refine and readjust as you go.', '*Refer to Appendix B for tons of resources on learning both important and coveted skills.', 'For complicated skills, I sometimes spend up to 8 hours planning it out. Remember the word “deliberate”. Your planning won’t be perfect but remember, it’s all about experimenting to see what works best for you.', 'Another key to following through on anything you do in life is having accountability. Join groups of like-minded people that will help you on your journey.', 'There’s really too much content here to make a short summary, but let me stress the following:', 'With a good system in place, learning new skills is not as hard as it seems. Learning varied skills will, in the near future, be the only way to thrive. People who start now will not only future-proof themselves, but also have the upper hand.', 'So what are you waiting for?', 'It’s time to skill up your life!', 'You can do this!', 'Thanks for reading, sharing, and following! :)', 'Check out my deeply actionable Course on 10 Skills to Improve Your Learning in 10 days.', 'The following is a list of some of the skills I’ve learned in the past 14 months.

The client was expecting 2000 leads per month, had launched their website a few weeks prior, had no social media presence and their 4–5 major competitors all had billion dollar businesses.', 'It was a tale of David and Goliath and they were not playing the part of either.', 'Before the scheduled time I agreed that my colleague would run the meeting to build up some experience in dealing with heated escalations. I was in the meeting only to observe, add some credibility and give him feedback at the end which would help him.', 'The client started off by telling us to talk about how we had got to where we were on that day while we looked at each other over a huge desk with egos ready to roar.', 'My colleague began fumbling around to try and explain it, but the words were not coming out. He opted to say as much as he possibly could. The two business owners were distracted the whole time. Every few minutes the door would swing open and the receptionist would whisper something and then walk out. Then one of the directors answered a call and said loudly “I’ll be there shortly” signaling that he had more important places to be at.', 'While the urge to talk was high, I sat in silence.', 'Once my colleague finished his summary, they began ripping us to shreds. They said that they liked dealing with the two of us but that the people we work with were no good, our product was broken, our strategy was wrong and that they were mis-sold. The feedback was gut-wrenching for the two of us given our weakness towards being obsessed with having happy clients.', 'The back and forth on both sides filled up most of our short meeting. Progress was not being made and we were losing the fight to what I’d describe as a weak argument. In short, what they were expecting was impossible and if they thought about their concept of 2000 leads a month from a few hundred dollars, they’d see what we could see.', 'The meeting was nearly over and I’d still said nothing. My body language told the story the way Benjamin Franklin would of. Then, in an instance, one of the directors said:', '“What do you think? We haven’t heard you speak?”', 'I purposely left a few moments of silence. The two directors stopped being distracted by their phones for a moment.', 'Then I said something that could have been career ending for me:', '“Gentlemen, 2000 leads a month is total bullshit. I’d be lying if I sat here any longer and pretended that we can ever deliver that to you. The only way we can move forward is if we agree to be honest with each other from this point on.”', 'There was a further silence.', 'I’d struck a nerve by calling out the elephant in the room that can only be spotted by sitting in silence and watching everybody react.', 'It was no longer about egos. Honesty was what was missing and everyone knew it once I stated the obvious and used a swear word to emphasize my point. All I said for that entire meeting were those two sentences. I didn’t speak another word.', 'With those two sentences, everyone’s thoughts were interrupted. The initial intent of the client was to discontinue our service and potentially engage their lawyer. By the end of the meeting, we had rapport and an understanding that we’d work to find a resolution.', 'In the Uber on the way back to the office, my colleague asked for feedback and he wasn’t talking about what he’d done well. I thought about it for a moment and tried to come up with something that would help him next time.', 'In a meeting that involves one or more people who are angry, having you talk your mouth off doesn’t build momentum.', 'Once you listen for long enough, you’ll hear the problem on repeat and then when the time is right, all you need to do is clearly articulate it to the room and leave some silence for people to contemplate it.', 'When people set up meetings, they focus on what they’re going to say and how they can cover off on as much as they can by the end of the meeting.', 'If the outcome involves influencing the rest of the people in the meeting to do something, letting them speak should be the focus. When people are heard first, they tend to listen to what you say when it’s your turn.', 'Silence breeds curiosity and curiosity leads to a conversation where someone will listen to you.', 'A quality outcome is better than a long meeting that leads nowhere, where everyone is being candid and honesty is not the center of attention.', 'Efficiency and time management in meetings has become the focus when the aim shouldn’t be productivity; the outcome should be to get a solution, an answer or an outcome.', 'When time is short, you tend to be able to get to the heart of the issue quicker and ignore pleasantries, unnecessary stories and general time wasting.', 'Short meetings create focus.', 'Eventually, the members of the meeting will be dying to talk to the one person that has said nothing.', 'I’ve been in a few meetings over the years with entrepreneurs who achieved more success than I could muster up in twenty-five lifetimes and one thing has stood out to me:', 'These tycoons of business say less.', 'Saying less forces people to be intrigued by you and this holds tremendous power which can solve some of the biggest challenges we face as a human race.', 'The meeting I described above will show you that when everyone in a room commits to being honest, an outcome can be reached in record time.', 'Stating how important honesty is in a meeting might seem useless, but when it’s done properly, it reminds everybody what matters. Transparency is sexy and people appreciate it more than you think.', 'As humans, we tend to repeat patterns. In the context of a meeting with an angry client, this can lead both sides to focus on being right and defending their point of view with their ego.', 'The way to break the pattern is to use a few short sentences to interrupt everyone’s thinking. Saying the one thing that everyone is too scared to say is the best solution I’ve found.', 'Once the pattern of the meeting is broken, it forces people to think more deeply. When we’re forced into these states, we find hidden solutions, empathy and our human side. Pattern interrupts open the door for rapport.', 'It’s an excellent reflection of how the meeting is going. The ones who sit in silence may not speak any words, but they’re telling you what they think by the way they’re sitting/standing and the position of their arms.', 'And that person may have the lowest status or title.', 'The one in a meeting saying the least can often have a very different perspective. The least qualified person may hold the most wisdom.', 'I walk into meetings all the time being the least qualified and I’ve found that to be a superpower more often than not.', 'When you don’t have knowledge or experience blocking your perspective, you can see problems and solutions in a different light.', 'Being the least qualified has also helped me dial my ego down and that’s translated to better outcomes.', 'Practice saying less. Watch. And then be surprised.', 'Join my email list to stay in touch.']

I had been on vacation for a month, then I got sick and was bedridden for a week, then I came back to Canada, moving from one home to the next.', 'Needless to say, my productivity tanked. I even made half the money I usually make during the last two months. Therefore, I can’t stress that enough:', 'A strong morning routine sets you up for a productive day, leading to more wins. More wins raise your motivation and allow you to accomplish your goals with greater ease.', 'But let me get this straight, in this guide, I will not tell you at what time to wake up as it is essentially useless to put everyone on the same boat. We’re all in different situations and my ideal time to wake up can’t be the same for you.', 'This guide instead focuses on principles that allow anyone to build a routine that works for them. For the most part, these principles are timeless and can be revisited months and years away and still work.', 'A morning routine is essentially a set of actions you perform in the morning, usually before starting your day’s main activity like going to work or to school. The actions can be anything from drinking a glass of water or brushing your teeth to doing a two-hour workout or running around the block.', 'For example, my routine this month will look like this:', 'In green are things related to daily activities, in blue are things I do for my personal brand, and in yellow are skills I’m practicing.', 'Below, I’ll explain why my routine is set that way and why that is a strong morning routine.', 'Let’s note again that your routine doesn’t have to be like mine and you certainly don’t have to wake up at the same time I do. What’s important is that it remains largely the same every day of the week, turning each action into a habit.', 'Habits, by nature, are “mechanical” behaviours you don’t have to give too much thought into; your brain takes care of performing it on auto-pilot. Do you have to think about how to brush your teeth? No, your habit takes care of it.', 'More on habits in the section: “Why is it so important?”.', 'A strong routine is a routine that works for you — it sets your day so that you accomplish meaningful results right away, giving you the energy to be motivated for the rest of your day.', 'Notice how in the description above I’m not mentioning the “how” and the “when”?', 'It’s because it really doesn’t matter!', 'What’s essential is that you find a set of activities that lead you to results you personally find meaningful. We’ll call these “wins” going forward. The order also matters. We’ll get to that shortly.', 'In my above case, writing for an hour is a great way for me to dump my thoughts that formed in my subconscious overnight. Remember the saying: “Sleep on it”? It really works. I have so many ideas of things to write after waking up as a result. I have a dopamine rush every time I’m satisfied with a section I complete and when I hit that “publish” button, setting myself up for my next task.', 'This month, I’m experimenting with working out right after writing. By using the first hour after waking up to do a creative activity, I’ll use my physical energy to balance things out. I don’t yet know if that will work for me or not since it’s different order than usual.', 'After the workout — surprise, surprise — it’s time for a shower, and here’s why I think it’s well-timed:', 'In the highly popular Learning to Learn Coursera course, Dr. Terrence Sejnowski demonstrated the benefits of physical activity to stimulate the brain for learning. Couple that with the benefits of the stimulation you get from a passive activity like a shower, I’m setting myself up for increased learning potential for my next activities.', 'Can you guess what those are?', 'Right! Deliberate skill learning!', 'To be honest, this is my favourite part of the day. People ask me how I can learn so many things so quickly; that’s how. My brain is stimulated for maximum learning potential.', 'I split my skill learning into three sessions of 30 minutes, practicing skills that work different areas of my brain, from logical to creative, with everything in between. That’s how I went from being a mostly logical person to being well-balanced in both creative and logical activities. That’s how I accidentally became a polymath.', 'After being awake for four hours is when I finally have my breakfast. This is a form of intermittent fasting, a method said to have many health benefits and may even lead to living longer. For me, it just gives me extra energy to go through the day.', 'I gave you a glimpse of how I’m personally ordering my own activities just above, but how can you do that yourself now? What gives me the most energy and motivation is not necessarily the same for you.', 'Plus, it’s likely that you cannot easily get yourself 4.5 hours of “free” time to perform your morning routine. As such, it’s important to realize what is 20% of the activities that will give you 80% of the results you want to achieve.', 'On top of knowing those, realizing what order makes the “most sense” to your brain will require experimentation. The compound effect of creative work + physical exercise + passive activity may not yield the same intensity it does for me. Maybe it’s better for you to do this order: physical exercise + passive activity + creative work.', 'In the “How can I build a strong morning routine?” section below, we’ll touch on the topic of defining what those activities are for you personally.', 'The way you start your day defines your mood for the rest of it. Better start it right then!', 'It’s all about the wins you get right from the start. When you accomplish things soon after waking up, however small the activity, your brain produces much-needed dopamine.', 'According to integrativepsychiatry.net, insufficient levels of dopamine can lead to a wide range of serious symptoms, including:', 'You don’t want that now, do you?', 'Isn’t it true that if you start the day in a reactive mode (reading your Facebook or Instagram feed, or replying to emails, or watching TV, etc.), you’re less motivated to start your productive activities? You go to work or school with the feeling that you don’t want to do it.', 'And motivation is only a part of it.', 'Imagine the amount of pleasure and satisfaction you get right at the beginning. A strong and consistent routine breeds wins. Wins = dopamine production. Consistent wins then turn into habits.', 'Take going to the gym for example. It’s so much harder to go the second week after you sign up. But if you push through the pain and continue for a month, it’s so much easier to get your butt out to the gym then. It has become a habit.', 'You can learn more about the importance of habits in Charles Duhigg’s fascinating book: The Power of Habits.', 'This is just a brain dump. Write down everything that comes to mind — however meaningless it may seem to you. You’ll later find a use for it in Steps 2 and 3.', 'This is a good exercise to get clarity on where you spend your time during the day.', 'It’s important to realize what you think is more important for you. By knowing what’s more important, it’s easier later to decide where to put each task on your calendar.', 'Spend a good amount of time figuring this out. Here’s what it looks like currently for me as an example:', 'I give more importance to tasks that relate to my Medium writing and my Virtual Coworking for example.', 'For each task you listed in step 1, place it in the right quadrant in the Eisenhower Matrix. You want as many of them to be in quadrant #2.', 'This will give you clarity on what needs to be done and what’s important and what’s not.', 'This is important. You need to be aware of how a long a task is going to take you. Be realistic and precise.', 'Using the same tool from Step 2, here’s what it looks like for me:', 'You can also use specific amounts of time you think activities within each project will take. Again, the more precise the better.', 'Now that you know what’s most important and how long tasks take you, place it in your daily calendar, similar to the image I put in the “What’s a morning routine?” section above, re-pasted here for simplicity:', 'You can use a physical calendar or a tool like Google Calendar or Airtable (like above). Refer to it often. No one has the mental capacity to remember everything right away.', 'That is crucial! Try not to miss a day. Every missed day “doubles” the effort needed to get started.', 'Have you noticed how after vacation, going back to executing your routine is so much harder?

Draw a little something, jot down some notes in your notebook, jam to a song you know, etc. Just make sure it’s not something reactive like replying to an email.', 'Schedule your hardest task for when you know your mind is the sharpest. So many times we try to solve difficult problems when we’re tired, wasting precious time on something you won’t figure out at that moment.', 'Recognize when that happens, take a break, and jump back on the problem after. Take note of what time during the day you can’t function properly and, as much as possible, don’t schedule hard tasks during that time.', 'The simple answer: for as long as it works!', 'I personally alter mine every month. Sometimes it’s very different, sometimes it’s similar. The reason I do that is not that the routine is ineffective, but rather to see if I can figure out an even stronger one.', 'Like anything in life, experimentation is a golden rule to knowing what works and what doesn’t. Plus, as you make new findings, things that used to work don’t necessarily work today. If you don’t try something else, you don’t know that its strength has shrunk.', 'Therefore, as per the simple reason above, it’s crucial to realize when a routine doesn’t work for you anymore. Refer back to the section on “Why is it so important?” to recall what are the benefits of a strong routine. If you don’t see the benefits anymore, it’s time to change!', 'Building a strong morning routine is not as hard as it seems and the benefits are undeniable. Having more energy and motivation throughout the day can turn you from procrastinator to high performer.', 'Figure out what works best for you by following the 6-step process on how to build a strong morning routine.

There, nearly three hours into the event, they made the announcement: not only will they have fully autonomous vehicles ready years ahead of the industry’s best estimates, Tesla expects to have a fleet of one million robotaxis on the road in 2020.', 'This time, there wasn’t the usual whooping and hollering from the Tesla loyalists. Instead, this was an event for investors. It was a more steadied and almost scholarly affair, with dizzyingly deep dives into the technology powering Tesla’s self-driving ambitions.', 'And the announcements—carrying world-changing ramifications, if the numbers are right—were delivered aloud into otherwise pindrop silence. It seemed the collective reaction of those in the room was a furrowed brow. Could Elon be believed? Still, onward he pressed, proclaiming a grand vision as though he’d only just returned from the future to share what he had seen. Maybe the claims seemed too far-fetched, maybe the event was too long, or perhaps it’s because the investors at the event were, for the most part, non-technical.', 'As someone in the tech industry myself, I had a hard time keeping up with the swirling Acronym Soup shared by presenters like Pete Bannon, esteemed former-Apple chip designer. But the overall message resonated: Tesla is ahead, they argued, because Tesla has the data. Whereas nearly every competitor is relying on Lidar, Tesla has placed their self-driving bets almost entirely on computer vision. Choosing to rely on cameras and cheap radar + ultrasonics has allowed them to deploy these sensors on every car they’ve sold for the past several years. Having sensors on every vehicle means they’ve been able to collect data from every mile driven from every Tesla produced in the past several years. That’s a huge number, and it’s increasing rapidly.', 'Lidar, meanwhile, is power hungry and expensive, adding anywhere from around $7K to $70K to the cost of the vehicle. The upshot is that the major Lidar-based competitors have several hundred cars on the road each, while Tesla has nearly half a million. And machine learning, which is needed for object recognition in any self-driving system, depends on access to mountains of data. In fact, it thrives on it — there’s a direct correlation between how much data you throw at a neural network and the quality of the results. Because they make their own cars, and because they’ve bet on cheaper sensors, Tesla is now sitting on an unmatched (and possibly unmatchable) pile of data, and that pile grows with each mile driven, with the rate of growth multiplying with each new vehicle sold.', 'In that light, Elon emphatically assures us their self-driving capabilities are improving “exponentially”, which would make the advent of full autonomy arrive much sooner than expected (and, frustratingly, will also make estimating its exact arrival date even more difficult). To demonstrate these advances, they gave investors fully-autonomous rides in standard off-the-shelf Teslas with remarkable capability improvements over the previous generation of software. In other words, given their advances in chip hardware and their substantial lead in real-world data, the final piece of their self-driving puzzle is software. Software which, once ready, can be deployed at the push of a button.', 'With the facts and figures out of the way, they delivered the real shocker of the event: robotaxis. As early as next year, your Tesla will be able to drive you home as you read a book, they say, as well as go off to make money for you as an autonomous robotaxi whenever you like. You can make money while you sleep, or earn a second paycheck while at your day job. The car can pay for itself, and then some.', 'Now, even taking that with the massive tablet of salt called “regulatory approval” combined with a healthy schedule adjustment to pad for Elon Time™, that’s still a staggeringly audacious proposal. Especially when you consider their back-of-the-napkin math:', 'A $38K car bringing in $200K of income on its own? That’s insane. That’s impossible. And that’s being spearheaded by a team famous for achieving the impossibly insane.', 'Whether or not they accomplish this latest feat, it’s a fascinating thought experiment. Assuming the tech works, what would happen next? Let’s assume this back of the napkin math is right, and that every car is worth more than what you’ll pay for it:', 'As with the current ubiquity of ridesharing traffic today, the demand for robotaxis may be so high that entry-level Model 3s become the majority of cars on the street. The number of these robotaxis will increase unless and until we encounter one of several possible limiting factors:', 'Or:', 'Tesla may choose to limit the number of cars a single individual purchases to inhibit the creation of fleets. But as their goal is to “accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy”, allowing intrepid entrepreneurs to flood the roads with fleets of cheaper, safer, and greener robotaxis would certainly help this mission.', 'It doesn’t hurt that they’ll also be stuffing Tesla’s pockets (and their own) while they do.', 'What’s your take? Will Tesla be the first out the door with full self driving? Will robotaxis be the money printing machines they’re purported to be?

I love meeting new people. As a result, I have been very fortunate to build an extensive network. The older I get, the more I realize how much this network has helped me get to where I am today. People underestimate the value of networking in their success. Most would say absolute success (vs. relative success) is the result of a combination of talent, hard work and luck. If you don’t have any talent, you are unlikely to offer anything of value to others. If you don’t work hard, you can’t hone your talent and build something of value. And even if you have all the talent in the world and you work non-stop, you need luck to get you exposure and opportunity. I would add that building the right network can increase your odds of success. In other words, you can create your own luck when you have a strong network.', 'I was inspired to write this post after coming across this article Before Social Media Killed Hollywood Nightlife in the Hollywood Reporter. I was fascinated by seeing all of these young actors cavorting in L.A. clubs before they became famous celebrities. I wondered how many were already famous before these photos were taken and most were still unknowns at the time (circa 2001). You can see a photo of a young Jason Momoa ten years prior to his breakout role as Khal Drogo in Game of Thrones and now the billion dollar Aquaman. There’s a photo of Scarlett Johansson who wouldn’t have her breakout role in Lost in Translation until 2003. It would make sense if they were already celebrities that they would run in the same social circles, but that was not the case. It seems like too much of a coincidence that so many of the photos show so many young actors and actresses together before they made it. Obviously these are selective photos and there are probably dozens of others with people who didn’t make it big, but the fact remains that these future Oscar-winners and blockbuster movie stars were connected before they were famous. One must wonder to what degree they helped one another get there along the way through introductions and access.', 'Just the other day, I was visiting the Gauguin exhibit at the DeYoung Museum in San Francisco. I noticed that Paul Gauguin was friends with Camille Pissarro and it struck me how many of the masters were socially acquainted. I always thought that it was an odd coincidence that the great Impressionists were all friends (and they were most definitely not already famous at the time). In fact, most of them were rejects of the prestigious Paris Salon and were forced to exhibit their work at the Salon des Refusés (French for exhibition of rejects) in 1863. Paul Cézanne briefly attended the Atelier Suisse with Camille Pissarro and in 1862 became lifelong friends with Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Claude Monet. In 1894, he visited Monet in Giverny who introduced Cézanne to Auguste Rodin and critic Gustave Geffroy. Once again, it clearly is too much of a coincidence that all of these great artists knew one another before they became famous. A week after I saw the exhibit I came upon this timely article: Artists Become Famous through Their Friends, Not the Originality of Their Work. This interactive network diagram from the MoMa demonstrates the power of connections with Wassily Kandinsky and Pablo Picasso in the center. The study performed by Columbia Business School professor Paul Ingram and his colleague Mitali Banerjee, of HEC Paris, found that “artists with a large and diverse network of contacts were most likely to be famous, regardless of how creative their art was…Specifically, the greatest predictor of fame for an artist was having a network of contacts from various countries.”', 'Obviously it’s hard to know whether these groups of friends would go on to succeed the way they did, but they clearly were talented. All of this assumes a minimum base level of talent in order to succeed or even be accepted into the network. I dreamed of being the first Asian-American NBA star as a ten year-old. But it wouldn’t have mattered how many NBA scouts, GMs or owners I knew, because I didn’t have the physical talent or basketball IQ to be Jeremy Lin (although I did have a mean jump shot). The point is that in order to improve your chances of success, you need to invest in your network. Your network can grant you access to opportunities.', 'You still need talent to succeed, but a lot of people are talented. Your network helps you break out by giving you a chance. If you look at the works of the great masters and objectively compare them to other artists of that time that did not become famous, I doubt you would really be able to tell the difference. There are many actors or singers who are just as talented as those who are celebrities, but they just never got their shot. Platforms like YouTube have somewhat leveled the playing field. You can go on YouTube and find tens of thousands of amazing voices and because of the disintermediation of record labels, more unknowns who didn’t previously have access or a network have managed to break out (Justin Bieber, Alessia Cara, Shawn Mendes, etc.).', 'In the world of startups, your network grants you access to capital, talent, partnerships and much more. Access gives you a leg up on your competition and helps you win. Social capital leads to human capital and financial capital. When you know the right people you can recruit the best talent through your network and you can get in front of the best investors. The PayPal Mafia is the prime example of the power of your network. Chad Hurley, Steve Chen and Jawed Karim were all at PayPal before starting YouTube which was funded by Sequoia partner Roelof Botha who was also at PayPal. Jeremy Stoppelman started Yelp with Russel Simmons and was funded by Max Levchin, all PayPal alumni. Yes, individually they were all talented and had the potential to succeed, but having those critical relationships improved their odds.', 'As an early employee at Yahoo!, I was fortunate enough to know many of those who went on to do amazing things. My friend Albert Lee was a fellow product manager who went on to build MyFitnessPal into a $500 million company and raised money from Andrew Braccia, who was in business development with us at Yahoo! long before he became the influential partner at Accel that went on to invest in Slack, Etsy, HotelTonight, 99Designs and Braintree. Albert is now an investor in my company Pared. The next generation of mafias are coming out of the unicorns of Uber and AirBnb as some graduate to the venture world and others become founders that they invest in. Powerful networks such as Y Combinator, a handful of MBA programs and premium portfolios such as First Round Capital are force multipliers for these networks.', 'Networks grant access. Access increases opportunities. Capitalizing on opportunities leads to success. Timing and talent are important factors, but having the right network to leverage when you need it vastly improves your probability of success. In other words, like in surfing, you have to be in the right position to catch the big wave when it comes. Your network sets you up to take advantage of that wave instead of being behind and desperately paddling to catch up it.', 'There are no shortcuts to building a strong network. You can add all of the random connections on Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn and your network could still be worthless. A network is only as strong as the individual relationships and connections you have. If you only have weak ties, it’s unlikely you will be able to leverage them in a time of need. In other words, quality > quantity. The Silicon Valley mafias exist because those people went to war together in the trenches. They created strong bonds through good times and bad while building startups into empires. Not everyone can have that type of shared experience, but there are other ways you can build your network with authentic connections:', 'People want to connect with you if you have something of value to offer. This is where the talent comes into play, because hopefully you have something to offer! This doesn’t have to be monetary or physical, it could be your expertise or access to your network. I get requests for introductions from friends and acquaintances all of the time because they see I’m connected to someone. I also get requests to meet up to give advice on building startups, growth marketing, fundraising, hiring and other insights from my personal experience. One way to amplify your expertise and value to others who are not in your sphere of influence is to blog or write thought leadership pieces (like this one!). If you can prove your content is worthy of the validation of the masses, people will ask you to speak on panels and do podcast interviews and more. This will continue to expand the audience who find value in your ideas. I recently wrote one Medium post about marketplaces that went viral and it was shared by influencers and people I respect but never interacted with before. The post led to new incredibly valuable relationships. When you create value for others, people will want to connect with you which will in turn increase the size and value of your network = Flywheel.', 'Add people on LinkedIn because it is how other people will find value in your network. I get requests for introductions all the time to people I’m connected to. I only accept invitations or connections to people I’ve actually interacted with. That way I can always reference that interaction or how we met when reaching back out again, even if it was years ago. Don’t randomly accept all of the spammy invites you get from people wanting to connect because “I came across your profile and wanted to connect!” Ignore. You will only dilute your network if you accept random connections. When someone in the future asks you for an introduction to someone and you have no context or idea how you’re connected, it will be very awkward to say you don’t really know them. People use LinkedIn to measure the value of your network as a reflection of you. They subconsciously signal off of how many mutual connections you have and the quality of those connections. I’m not saying it’s a perfect proxy for someone’s talent or ability, but people use whatever cues they have to evaluate others worth, and your network is one of them.', 'Not many people know this, but I’ve been friends with Guy Kawasaki for years. I was starting my first company at the time and was so inspired by reading The Art of the Start that I decided to cold e-mail him for his advice. He actually responded and we had breakfast a week later. Over the years, we would get together and talk about social media and marketing. Guy is one of the best in the business of building a personal brand and I’ve learned so much from him. I would never have benefited from all of his sage wisdom if I hadn’t e-mailed him. Never be afraid to reach out to someone, because the worst response you can get is a “no” or no response at all. You shouldn’t take it personally because anyone worth getting to know is probably very busy. I can almost guarantee you that if you reach out to a busy CEO or influencer with a personalized e-mail about their product/service, book, essay, or speech that they will at the very least take the time to write a response. They might even respond with an invitation to have breakfast with them.', 'If you always socialize in the same circles, you will never expand your network. Seeing the same people regularly either because of shared industry, interests or geography limits the new relationships you can make. Spend time fostering relationships in different domains and industries. Andrew Chau, the founder of Boba Guys, is quite possibly one of the most well-connected people I know. Andrew has invested time and energy in building bridges across industries from food to politics to entertainment to fashion to sports to tech. His network is extremely valuable to many because its reach extends across the country and around the globe. By crossing over into different industries, he multiplies the number of other supernodes he is connected to which amplifies his network. The thing is, Andrew rarely asks for anything, he is always giving and creating value for others. Oftentimes this value comes from his connections and access. In other words, his network helps him create value for his network (very meta). He also happens to be an ingenious marketer who is deeply plugged in to cultural trends.', 'Everyone appreciates it when you support them in their efforts no matter how much. If someone is launching a product, tweet about it or share it with your network. If someone is fundraising ask if you can be helpful with introductions. If someone has successfully fundraised, congratulate them publicly. If someone has news to share, help them share it to a wider audience. No matter who you are, when you have something you’re trying to promote, you will always appreciate those who support you in your endeavors. Whenever I publish a new essay on Medium, I’m always thankful to those who retweet it or share it because it drives more traffic and readership.', 'Be generous with your time. Your time is valuable, but if you only do things because you’ll selfishly get something out of it, then you will often end up being disappointed. I am very intentional about being open to helping others. I don’t help them because I expect anything in return, I do it because I can. Pay it forward. If I can help someone else with my expertise or network, then why wouldn’t I meet with them? This openness has paid back dividends tenfold in what I’ve spent in time. People I’ve helped along the way have made incredibly valuable introductions, asked me to be an advisor, and have given me critical advice in return. Those who believe in karma can relate to this. Obviously you only have so many hours in the day so you can’t always be responsive, but you can always be open.', 'When you have an extensive network, you will have a lot of opportunities to connect people who would otherwise not intersect. As a node, you will be the only one who can see the valuable potential between two of your friends. Whether you’re connecting a founder to an investor or a customer to a buyer, there are countless reasons to bring two people together. Malcolm Gladwell refers to these natural hubs and human supernodes in The Tipping Point as “connectors”. By creating opportunities for others, people will be extremely grateful and may potentially return the favor down the road. Got rejected by Y Combinator or Stanford Business School? Start a force multiplying community of your own. Bring like-minded people together whether it be online or offline. When others see that you are a connector, they will refer more people to you and the group. Before you know it, you will have created a valuable network for yourself and more importantly for others.', 'I hate “networking” as much as the next person. When I see a someone superficially schmoozing, I roll my eyes too. People can generally tell when someone is trying too hard and clearly just want something. The people with the strongest networks are the ones who build real relationships because those are the ties that you can count on. Friends always ask me how I know so many people. My superpower is that I have a somewhat photographic memory for faces which helps me to remember people, although this has declined with age. I could remember someone I met only briefly over twenty years ago or see a photo of someone and remember the context (this has definitely freaked people out). This has obviously been a powerful gift when building my network, but it’s more important that I remember the things that matter to people I meet because I care enough to remember. Be yourself. Be authentic. If you genuinely care about people, they will sense that. Invest generously in others and you will see returns for a lifetime.', 'If you enjoyed this post, please check out some of my other Medium articles:']

I’m going to call this colleague Freddie. Freddie had been at the company for a few of weeks, so naturally, I asked him how things had been going. What he went on to say has stuck with me since. He started with a sigh and spoke about how he had been having trouble understanding the codebase he had inherited on the particular project he was working on.', 'Freddie then spent a good deal of time telling me about how he had become irritated and weary from staring at a behemoth of a function that made no sense. I asked him if he tried checking with one of his teammates who had been working on the software before him, to which he responded with a slight chuckle and said the following, “(Teammate’s name) had no clue either. He stared at it as intently as I did and simply said that he didn’t write it.”', 'I told myself two things after my conversation with Freddie. The first one was, “Don’t be that guy!”. That is, don’t be like the person who made Freddie suffer. The second was, “Write better functions”. That’s the only way to not be like that guy. I’m sure there are countless Freddie’s out there who have to inherit, make sense of and refactor badly written functions on software projects. Well crafted software takes concern for the small units (or methods) such as functions at the micro level and not just the overall functionality at the macro level.', 'I’ve written a lot bad functions in my short coding time, and so I became deliberate about improving in this particular area. Below are some guidelines and approaches that I’ve learned (and am still learning) to apply from experienced professionals, colleagues, and other recommended sources.', 'Understanding Functions', 'Defining things is always a good place to start. Functions are programmed procedures. If you’re looking for something more verbose than that, you’ll have to go to Google. Software systems will comprise of functions to varying degrees. It may be that you’re developing software with an Object Oriented design in which the functions will live inside the classes that make up the system, and those functions act on the state of the classes in which they live. Or maybe your system is a Function oriented design, in which the system is decomposed into a set of interacting functions acting on centralised state. Regardless of the approach, functions exist because we need to decompose our solution concept, and at a very low level of this decomposition, we find these small units that serve a specific purpose.', 'Functions Should Be Small', 'Keeping things small makes functions easier to read, understand, test and debug. I’m not going to give you a magic number. Some experts would say not more than 15 lines, others would say not more than 25. It’s probably something you’ll have to decide within your team. The important thing is to remember the reasons for the principle of keeping functions small.', 'Readability: A function will typically have a signature and a block code which is executed when the function is called or invoked. Having fewer lines of code in the function’s block helps to easily read and get the gist of what the function is supposed to do.', 'Understandability: Smaller functions help reduce the likelihood of deviating from the main purpose of a function. The more linear the concept or purpose of the function is, the more comprehensible it will be.', 'Testability: Short methods have fewer variations which means they are easier to test.', 'Here’s an example of a function that is meant to check the validity of a bearer token:', 'Functions Should Be Clean', 'It probably doesn’t get more ambiguous than that.

I understand that there are other attributes that would be used to define clean code that are subjective and that’s something you and your team can decide on.', 'Functions Should Be Simple', 'Something my Tech Lead would often say to me is, “If it (the function) requires a lot of effort, you should stop and rethink your solution”. In our field, effort shouldn’t always be applauded, because more often than not, effort produces something complex.', '“In software development, effort doesn’t grow linearly with complexity — it grows exponentially. Therefore, it is easier to manage two sets of four scenarios each than one with six.” — Abraham Marín-Pérez', 'If we can write functions based on a modularised solution, and reduce the paths of execution that the function has, it will be a lot easier to make sense of what they should be doing. When code isn’t simply written, it’s a lot harder to make sense of and these kinds of misunderstandings often lead to bugs.', 'Here’s an example of a function that checks if a received argument is an array of strings:', 'Functions Should Have One Job (No Side Effects)', 'Robert Martin put it best in Clean Code, “Your function promises to do one thing…”, and therefore it should. Having side effects only makes our code less readable because of the variations in the code block that don’t serve that one specific purpose. Our functions should be based on a deterministic algorithm, given a certain input, it always returns the same output.', 'Take the following example, the function is meant to receive a particular date and return the week that the date occurs in the form of an array with date objects.', 'It could be argued that the function generally has a single purpose. However, you may have noticed that there’s a point at which we are generating the week based on two arguments, an object (Moment object in this case) and the days of the week (i.e. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, etc.). So we can actually create a new function from this one to simplify things and make our methods more linear in their purpose.', 'When we split our function into two, we have the following:', 'As a result, it is now easier for a random programmer to grasp the intent of our functions, make test cases for them and modify if necessary.', 'That being said…', 'These guidelines are not the only ones to be followed, but they certainly lay a good enough foundation in helping us produce high quality code when we write our functions. Furthermore, writing good functions will take practice, deliberate refactoring, and another set of eyes (peer reviews).

I just wanted to lose 15 (okay 20) pounds and figure out why I was tired all the time.', 'The fatigue wasn’t a new thing. But it was happening more frequently, especially after I ate. One morning, I was on my second cup of coffee, struggling to focus on the computer screen when I was forced to lay down. I simply couldn’t fight the urge to take a nap. An hour later, I woke up feeling rested — and worried.', 'What happened?', 'The fatigue hit me five minutes after finishing breakfast. Was it my blood sugar? Maybe I was hypoglycemic. Or diabetic. Or allergic to something.', 'I’d eaten a healthy breakfast: two slices of high fiber, organic toast topped with almond butter and sliced bananas. Surely that should have energized me.', 'But it turns out that while that “healthy” breakfast did have 13 grams of fiber and 13 grams of protein, it also had 23 grams of sugar. That’s more sugar than in a Krispy Kreme jelly doughnut!', 'It gets worse. I had eaten 71 grams of carbohydrates — more than twice as much as the 28 grams of carbs found in a Snickers bar. And since carbs turn into glucose (sugar) in the bloodstream, it’s no wonder I felt like I’d eaten two candy bars for breakfast!', 'I had never really thought about the impact of carbs on my health before. Oh sure, I knew people who had used low carb diets like Atkins or South Beach to lose weight. But I really had no idea how carbs affect metabolic health or the cardiovascular system.', 'I always thought complex carbohydrates (whole grain bread, brown rice, whole wheat pasta), were high in nutrients and fiber and therefore, healthy. But are they? Do they reduce biomarkers for disease or its cause, inflammation?', 'Indeed, there are a number of studies concluding that fiber promotes weight loss, reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes, eliminates constipation and improves gut health.', 'Those were some of the reasons I decided to experiment with eating 25 grams of fiber every day for a month. In fact, I had continued that high fiber diet even after my experiment.', 'But that was before my sugar collapse. And it wasn’t the first time I’d had an energy dip after eating.', 'Then there was my weight. I’d been struggling to lose that extra 10 (really 20) pounds for at least two decades.', 'I thought the high fiber diet was helping, since it eliminated bloating and constipation. However, a trip to the doctor revealed the truth: I’d gained 2 pounds since last year. In fact, I’d gained between 1 and 3 pounds every year for the past five years.', 'She attributed it to aging, but that didn’t make sense to me. Plenty of people who are older than I am are lean, and many of them don’t eat kale salads and quinoa every day.', 'I was not only eating plenty of high fiber carbs, I was avoiding processed food, cramming in as many vegetables as I could and exercising like a fiend.', 'I’d gone from working out three days a week to six. I incorporated high intensity interval training into my workouts and extended my cardio sessions. Yet my weight had actually gone up.', 'Why?', 'I stumbled onto an article by Dr. Jason Fung: Obesity Is a Hormonal Imbalance, Not a Chemical Balance, and I began to think about how frequently I was eating: a handful of pretzels when I passed the kitchen, a nibble of hummus and chips while making dinner, a bowl of popcorn after dinner. Yup, I was a snacker.', 'I guessed that my insulin was not functioning properly. I decided to try intermittent fasting — eating during an 8-hour window and fasting for 16 hours. It was ok, but I still had cravings for carbs. Then I discovered the ketogenic diet.', 'I decided to try it for a month. Here’s what happened.', 'The weight just dropped off. And I not only lost pounds — 10 to be exact — I also lost 1 inch from my hips (my problem area) and went down a dress size! Even better: it was effortless.', 'Like a whole lot. Like if there was a contest for most pee excreted in a given day, I could easily take top honors.', 'I know what you’re thinking: it’s just about losing water weight. That’s not real weight loss. It’s a scam. It’s this year’s grapefruit diet. Believe me, if I had no experience with keto, I would be thinking the same things.', 'But indulge me for a moment in the wee bit of science I’ve been able to pick up since starting my keto journey. It turns out that when your body shifts from burning glycogen (carbohydrate stores) to burning fat, you excrete a whole bunch of water and sodium. Apparently, for every gram of glycogen your body stores, it also stores 3 grams of water. Those 3 grams of water are actually bound to every gram of glycogen.', 'So when you begin depleting your glycogen stores, you also lose a lot of water. This accounts for the fast weight loss many people enjoy on keto. So yes, it is water weight.', 'However, that doesn’t mean you’ll gain it back or that after a few weeks or that you’ll stop losing weight on keto.', 'This was my experience of the so-called “keto flu.” It’s not a stuffy nose kind of flu, but rather a lethargy that kind of descends on you.', 'I noticed symptoms of fatigue about three days in. About two weeks in, I found myself getting dizzy while trying to exercise, and about three weeks in, I found it difficult to complete a workout.', 'Ten hours and about 30 articles, podcasts and You Tube videos later, I came to the conclusion that my electrolytes were low. The fix: get more sodium.', 'Stephen Phinney, MD, Ph.D, who has spent 40 years studying nutritional biochemistry, suggests getting 5 grams of sodium per day on a ketogenic diet. That’s a lot — the equivalent of 2.5 teaspoons of salt. (Remember, salt includes both sodium and chloride, not just sodium). And you have to get that every day because the body can’t store sodium.', 'I’m not going to lie. That’s been tough for me. I don’t eat a lot of processed food, and I can’t seem to just drink salted water or put a ¼ tsp. of salt on my tongue and chase it with water as many do.', 'My solution is to eat 4–5 olives per day (about 1 gram of sodium), drink bone broth, salt my food heavily and take salt tablets. It’s not ideal, but I’m getting there.', 'Most importantly, I no longer feel dizzy while exercising and I can easily get through the day without feeling tired.', 'If you read anything about keto, you’ll see stories of people having boundless energy. They can run 6, 12, 15 miles or more without feeling tired!', 'That hasn’t happened to me. Those people are likely fat adapted — a term doctors use to describe people who are successfully burning fat instead of sugar (glycogen) for energy. It’s the goal of everyone who goes on keto, but it doesn’t happen right away. In fact, some experts say it may take up to six months to become fully fat adapted.', 'In my case, after the initial keto flu ended, I’ve had plenty of energy to get through the day (thanks to an increase in sodium intake). But I am still unable to complete a full workout without feeling exhausted. I am trying to be patient with myself on this by reducing my workouts and giving my body time to adjust.', 'It isn’t a great side effect of the diet, but it’s manageable and, I hope, temporary.', 'After not having my period for nearly a year, I was surprised that within a few days of starting keto, I got a period. Three weeks later, I got another period.', 'According to my doctor, keto can be used to regulate hormones. Some women find it stops hot flashes. Others report that keto successfully resolves Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). (There’s a small study that discuss this.) Some men report that it resolves erectile dysfunction.', 'For me, the hormone changes were definitely beneficial, and they weren’t limited to sex hormones. I slept better and felt calmer overall (improved cortisol function?). I also enjoyed what I can only describe as a discovery of leptin, the hormone that controls satiety.', 'For the first time in my life, I could eat and feel truly satiated. No more feeling so full my stomach could burst, but still having room for that piece of chocolate cake.', 'The fullness I experience on keto is a whole new sensation. I feel satisfied, and I don’t want to eat anything else.', 'When I say diets don’t work for me, I don’t mean I’ve lost weight on diets before, then gained it back, or that I’ve tried diets that worked short term, but didn’t have lasting results. I mean I have never ever been able to stay on a diet.', 'Like ever.', 'Once, about 15 years ago, my neighbor successfully lost 25 pounds of post-baby weight on the Atkins diet, and I decided to give it a try. I couldn’t make it to lunch.', 'A few days later when my neighbor asked how the diet was going, I sheepishly said, “I think I’ll just wait for the all carb diet to become fashionable.”', 'The truth is I’ve eaten mostly carbs all of my life. Between the whole wheat pasta, sandwiches on whole grain bread, salads (fruits and vegetables are carbs, too) and the inevitable brownie or cake after dinner, I estimate that I was getting more than 200 grams of carbs per day. I never really cared for steak, and I’d flirted with going vegetarian a number of times, so carbs were truly the mainstay of my diet.', 'Going keto changed all of that for me. Now, I not only don’t mind eating more fat (lots of avocado) and protein (lots of bacon), I feel better when I do.', 'Anyone who’s ever been hangry knows the danger of that mid-afternoon dip when you need food — fast! That used to happened to me all the time, but not since starting keto. I just don’t get that insane I-want-to-rip-off-someone’s-head-if-I-can’t get-some-pretzels-now feeling anymore.', 'Even during my busiest, most stressful weeks, I don’t find myself snapping at my kids or craving a glass of wine or some cookies at the end of the day.', 'My memory is also better. I no longer go into a room and find myself forgetting why I’m there. And I can keep lists in my head, like I used to when I was in my 20s. I also get a wonderful sense of clear-headed focus while working.', 'I love food, and I enjoy eating, but I don’t crave food — especially carbs — any more. I thought I would miss pizza and muffins and cookies, but I’ve been delighted to find keto recipes for all of those things, and they taste good. Even better: I don’t get that carb hangover after eating them.', 'Being on keto is just easy. I’d even go so far as to say I enjoy eating more now, because I get to eat until I feel satisfied. Then I simply stop.', 'A little back pain here, a little neck pain there, those were the sensations I’d grown to live with. I was able to control them with targeted exercises, but now I just don’t have them.', 'I’m guessing it’s a reduction in inflammation. After all, when I started having back pain, the first prescription I got was an anti-inflammatory. But why take pills when you can reduce the inflammation from the inside?', 'A lot of people describe keto as an extreme or highly restrictive diet. I don’t think it’s either of those things. Today, I’ve eaten four slices of bacon, a piece of asparagus quiche, some olives, pulled pork, a Caesar salad and a chocolate tart made with avocado and coconut milk.', 'Now, I made all of those things myself. When I go out to eat, I have to avoid sugary sauces and salad dressings as well as starches, sweets and breads. Fried food would be fine if it didn’t have breading, but it nearly always does. And the majority of restaurants cook with unhealthy vegetable oils.', 'Interestingly, the restaurant world is happy to serve ketchup made with high fructose corn syrup, but when I replace French fries with asparagus as a side dish, they’re loathe to put a pat of butter on it. Apparently, the world still fears fat.', 'However, I am hopeful that things are changing. As more chefs learn that butter, coconut oil, olive oil, lard and beef tallow are healthy fats, perhaps we will see healthier restaurant options.', 'As for me, I have never looked forward to swimsuit season more. Perhaps I will have lost the remaining 10 pounds by then.', 'But even if not, I’m sticking with keto. I love the calmness, hormonal regularity, satiety, mental clarity, decreased inflammation and increased focus I get when I’m on keto. It’s true that I came to keto for the weight loss, but I’m staying for the health benefits.', 'Like this story and want more? Sign up for my newsletter now!', 'You may also like:']

Quantum immortality suggests you may have died. Some say this test will determine if it happened to you.', 'Have you had an unexplained accident where you should have died, but due to same random stroke of amazing luck, you managed to survive?', 'Were you ever so ill, you narrowly escaped death?', 'Afterwards, did you remember events differently from those around you?', 'One possible explanation is that you may have indeed experienced death in another timeline, but your consciousness continued in an alternate reality.', 'Jerry* had one such experience. He asked for his identity remain secret because he doesn’t want people to “think he is crazy.”', '“I know how this sounds,” he said. “I have been trying to figure this out for ten years. My family won’t talk to me about it.”', 'Jerry was driving on a highway when a pickup truck going the opposite direction crossed the center line. It happened so quickly, he didn’t have time to swerve.', '“The truck was so close, I couldn’t react,” Jerry said. “There was no avoiding it. We were going 65 or 70 miles per hour, and I knew I wouldn’t survive.” He shut his eyes and braced for impact.', '“I waited two, three seconds, but there was no crash, no sound of tires screeching,” Jerry said. “I opened my eyes and we were past the point of the collision and much further down the road than we should have been if we had simply missed each other. I looked in my rear view mirror, the truck was moving away from us, also much further away than it should have been, and no longer in our lane. The whole thing was just.\xa0.\xa0. impossible.”', 'While he brushed off the glitch as some sort of one-time seizure episode, Jerry noticed other strange things in the days that followed. The biggest difference occurred at his job.', '“I used to get along great with everyone at the warehouse, especially my boss who was also a good friend,” Jerry said. “After that day on the highway, everyone was suddenly hostile. My boss became an alcoholic within a few weeks and turned into a giant asshole. We were constantly butting heads over things that he said happened in the past, but I swear did not happen. I quit a few months later.”', 'Jerry also noticed strangers were different, more impatient and impolite. “People seemed to deliberately move in front of me, blocking my path,” he said. “Something\xa0fundamental\xa0in\xa0my\xa0reality shifted.”', 'Navigating the world became much more difficult. Success had been easy before and was now out of reach. Finding a new job was much more difficult than it had been in the past despite having high demand skills. There were other changes in popular culture, some were subtle and other more overt and bizarre.', '“I don’t talk about the shift because when I do, people get angry for no reason. I really think something happened with that accident and I am living in an alternate reality.”', 'Many people report disturbing experiences such as lifelong friends moving away without notice, family members behaving oddly, relationships deteriorating, and even physical changes in their own bodies, like new scars or disappearing moles.', 'Much of the change centers on shared memories of the past that do not match documented reality.', 'There are forums online where these individual share their experiences.', 'Quantum immortality started as a thought experiment in the late 1980s, and later was more fully developed by physicist and cosmologist Max Tegmark. It suggests we may die many times throughout our lives. With each passing, our consciousness moves, slides, jumps or shifts to the closest timeline, very similar to the one where we died.', 'It is a concept that was combined with other ideas and morphed into what Jerry and others suggest could have happened, among other potential explanations. These ideas and application of the concepts lie outside the realm of science, but have been embraced by many of those who believe they have experienced such a shift.', 'While science and skeptics may not agree, others are not so quick to dismiss the idea. There are reports of near death experiences which validate these beliefs.', ""Some additional details of my experience were that items had materialized within my belongings that I had not brought on the trip such as papers that were not mine, jewelry that I would best describe as having 'put itself together' such as an old pendant that I had lost was on a cord from material I didn’t pack. Items and souvenirs in a bag from a trip I had lost. Some items later appeared by themselves in the same bag that I reported to the towing company that I searched earlier that were no where to be found. Time seemed to be in 'sub-periods' of time in itself. Stephanie B"", 'Proponents cling to the “many world’s interpretation” of other realities where versions of “you” reside. Every potential outcome of different choices exists in these realms.', 'Countless universes spin off each time you are presented with a choice. These are marker events where you made a different decision that resulted in big changes such as a marriage to someone different, becoming a mass murderer, or death— the variations are endless.', 'At least, in the beginning they are.', ""The wheel WAS reality, itself. It represented EVERY CONCEIVABLE POSSIBILITY for a life or for a world that could ever be envisioned or imagined. As it approached, I became aware that what we call our world was contained within it. It was simply one of the numberless slots or paddles in the 'water wheel.' It had always been so. My life, your life, our world, all of us - we were a part of this wheel structure and we had always been a part of this structure. It simply now made itself visible to me. Wilson FDE"", 'Most people do not realize that they have jumped until later, unless the event is particularly traumatic. Sometimes, they can trace the shift back to a specific global tragedy or experience such as Jerry’s accident.', 'Small differences are sometimes noted, the result of earlier choices or decisions\xa0which\xa0manifest\xa0in\xa0the\xa0new\xa0reality. A dress may now be green instead of blue, or a friend goes by their middle name.', 'Others suggest a slide occurs for the entire world with major events such as 9/11 being one such marker. There is a cyclical nature to most shifts repeating every three or 11 years with the next major slide due in 2026 and again in 2029. These result in shared memories of a different past.', 'Some have suggested these changes are signposts for determining which reality the user is experiencing, like a type of naming convention.', 'This dimensional jumping occurs every time we make a fatal mistake. We didn’t swerve, we didn’t get to the hospital in time, etc. With each death, that timeline ceases to exist for us. The potential reality collapses and is closed off to us and we move to the next closest.', 'The different timelines exist, but our consciousness moves along only one path. It is this act of “observing"" that makes it “real.” Each person exists in their own universe with their particular choices and potential futures. These other timelines out there are not experienced just as I am not “real"" to you now. Because I am not observed by you, I am not part of your reality.', 'I exist to you as a potential -- someone you know is out there, but\xa0that\xa0you\xa0do\xa0not\xa0directly\xa0experience. My words, however, do exist because you are reading them. The possibility exists for you to meet me.', 'Make the right choices and your consciousness will travel along a path where you observe me, therefore I will cease being merely a potential,\xa0and become part of your\xa0reality. I will exist and become real. Move to a reality where I die, and any potential reality where I existed is closed off to you.', 'Each time you experience your own death and slide to a new reality, the number of potential timelines are further reduced. Quantum death does not equal the collapse of only one reality, but every reality where you have run out of options for existence as a result of that choice. Each person who dies in your reality collapses all timelines where they existed from the point of their death forward.', 'Like branches on a tree, your consciousness moves along the limbs until you meet your quantum demise, then you switch to an alternate path. By the time you reach your ultimate and final death, you have run out of alternate realities that haven’t collapsed. You are old and dying of cancer, there is only one possible timeline left because no others exist where you are alive. You die.', 'It is much like a vast map where we move from our starting point, our birth, to the end point, our final death. There are countless roads and byways to get us to our destination. Each choice moves us closer to that destination.', 'An example of this might be working in the World Trade Center during 9/11. Prior to the attack, there were numerous realities that may have been available such as going to work late, taking the elevator, entering from a different side, etc. Because of later events, all of these result in your death.', 'The only viable timelines are those where you took the day off, went in very late, were sick, your car broke down, etc. Because you died in all these other timelines, many potential realities closed off for you and your options were significantly limited. Any scenario where you were in that building is no longer open to you to experience. If you chose to be in the building that day, you experienced a quantum death. You slid to another timeline.', 'When there are no other realities to move to and you’ve exhausted all possible outcomes for you to live, then your consciousness experiences ultimate and final death.', 'So what happens when you shift to a timeline where you remember someone famous died in the past but in the new reality they are now alive -- like David\xa0Soul?', 'Neo: Whoa, déjà vu.Trinity: What did you just say?Neo: Nothing, I just had a little déjà vu.Trinity: What did you see?Cypher: What happened?Neo: A black cat went past us, and then another that looked just like it.Trinity: How much like it, was it the same cat?Neo: Might have been, I’m not sure.Morpheus: Switch, Apoc.Neo: What is it?Trinity: Déjà vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix. It happens when they change something.', 'Initially, switching timelines is usually seamless because there are so many more possible realities that are almost identical to the one you’re experiencing. You have a statistically low probability of encountering what makes the timeline different. But with each death and the collapse of more potential timelines, the odds improve that the changes are noticeable because the leap is greater.', 'People point to these glitches as evidence of the shift. Sometimes the changes are personal and known only to those having a direct experience, other times they are shared.', 'These shared experiences are known as the “Mandela Effect”, they are named after the first such mass incidence of what others categorize as a type of “false memory.” People remember the South African leader dying in prison sometime around 1991. This, of course, never happened.', 'This led to people sharing other events they remember as changing. While scientists claim this is merely people remembering events incorrectly, it raises the question why do so many people have the same wrong memories? Why do more people remember something wrong rather than the correct way? Why do people remember Nelson Mandela dying in prison and not something more probable such as an assassination?', 'A recent experiment provides evidence that individuals can share different yet equally valid realities, and there may be no objective true experience for everyone. It is worth noting that this experiment was based on Eugene Wigner’s “Friend Test” which also started as a thought experiment, similar to Tegmark’s Quantum Immortality. Science has since verified it in the laboratory. So there is hope that quantum immortality may be tested.', 'The rules are simple, don’t look up the answers, but answer the five questions below based on your memory of the events. There are dozens of these Mandela Events, I’ve chosen some of the most popular. You can take a more extensive test here.', '3. Is it “Etch-A-Sketch” or “Etch A Sketch”? If you remember the name having hyphens, you would be mistaken, along with more than 88% of people taking the test. Which leads us to question why hyphens? Why not an “Etcha Sketch” or “Etcher Sketcher”?', '4. Lincoln Memorial. Where are Lincoln’s hands? If you said resting over the arms of the chair, you may be living in another reality with more than 86% of the population. One hand is clenched in a fist.', '5. Michelangelo’s Creation of Adam. Who’s hand is higher, God’s or Adam’s? If you said God, you’re in good company. More than 86% of respondents chose this incorrect answer, too.', 'Many of these Mandela Effects trigger people into researching more about other false memories. It can be quite the deep rabbit hole. While science grapples to define reality, many people like Jerry aren’t waiting for answers. To them, timelines can change or even be manipulated.', 'https://medium.com/swlh/predictions-of-the-future-by-people-who-died-ebfda3a80c1f', 'Sign up for my newsletter.

I’ve seen some statistics that show a 60% failure rate, others a 90% failure rate. The exact number doesn’t matter — what matters is that most startups fail, it’s the norm, the expected outcome.', 'But surely it wouldn’t be my outcome, right? I’d beat the odds, my startup would succeed and, better yet, I’d succeed on the first startup I founded — I’d beat the odds and then beat the odds again.', 'At least that’s what I thought when myself and two other guys named Matt (that’s right, three cofounders = three Matts 👨👨👨) started Tali in February 2017. Two years later, it turns out I was wrong.', 'Sure, we had a bunch of wins — we had paying customers from across the globe, won $100k in a pitch competition and we raised nearly $1.0M of VC funding. But we had a bunch of lows too — nearly ran out of money several times over the course of a year, made engineering mistakes that caused users to churn, wasted money on paid marketing too early, and had technology problems that impacted user engagement, to name a few.', 'Startups are hard…like, really hard. And the decision to wind down your startup is an incredibly difficult one, yet it’s one that rarely gets talked about, despite the fact that most startups inevitably fail. There’s plenty of stories out there that glorify the startup grind — never give up! Eat breakfast cereal for dinner and sleep on your friends couch until you make it! Just keep going! — but very few stories on the harsh reality of how to make the decision to shut down your startup, and what it feels like to do so.', 'The truth is that making the decision to shut down your company is likely the most difficult one you’ll make along your startup journey…and it’s one that’ll hurt pretty bad.', 'I don’t know why this isn’t talked about more, but here’s my contribution to the greater good: my story of how I made the decision to shut down Tali, and what that feels like. Hopefully, it helps.', 'I’ve written in detail about the origin story of Tali and how we got started, which you can read here. Here’s the TL;DR version though:', 'We started the company in February 2017, received our first investment in June 2017, and launched our paid beta product in September 2017, six months after we initially got started.', 'Our strategy at Tali was to get a paid product into market as quickly as we possibly could. We wanted to do this for two reasons:', 'On the front-end or input side, we started with a focus solely on Amazon Alexa (we later added Google Assistant). In addition, we built a simple web application that a user could access online to see all of the time entries they captured with Tali (we called this the Tali dashboard). Last but not least, on the invoicing side we started with an integration approach — rather than build our own invoicing and billing system (which would require a lot of engineering effort and take time), we chose to integrate with Clio, a legal practice management solutions (we later added PracticePantherand Rocket Matteras integration partners as well).', 'We went to market at a price point of $90 for a three month subscription (or $30 per month). This price point was higher than our competitors, but we didn’t focus on this — instead, we looked at the value we were delivering to our user. If a lawyer bills out at $300/hr then each six minute increment of their day is worth $30…surely Tali could save you more than six minutes over the course of a month! We included a free Echo Dot to sweeten the deal for our customers, but also to avoid the objection of “I don’t have a smart speaker for my office so I can’t use this software.”', 'This product — the Amazon Alexa skill, the Tali dashboard, and the Clio integration — priced at $90 for a three month subscription (with a free Echo Dot) is what we launched in September 2017 at the Clio Cloud Conference in New Orleans…and people loved it! 💜', 'By December 2017, our paid user base had risen to 101 people from all across the globe. At $30/month, that’s $3,030 of monthly recurring revenue (MRR)…not bad for a product built mostly on nights and weekends by a team of three!', 'We launched, and then we realized we had a problem.', 'When a user created an account and submitted their credit card information for a $90 purchase, which got them three months of Tali, they were making a unique, one-time purchase.', 'We never built in the functionality for the subscription to automatically renew. 🤦\u200d♂️', 'This meant that everyone who had signed up would need to submit their credit card information AGAIN, or a second time to keep their Tali subscription going.', 'You’re probably cringing right now, which is the appropriate response. This meant I had to reach out to every person, all 101 people, to ask them to submit their credit card information again.', 'I e-mailed 📧', 'I called ☎️', 'I e-mailed again 📧', 'I called again ☎️', 'After all was said and done, I managed to get 22 people to submit their credit card information again. Let me do the math for you — that’s a 78% churn rate…ouch. 😟', 'Part of the churn problem we had was due to two product challenges — 1) our on-boarding flow and 2) an invocation issue impacting the user experience. After all, if every one of the 101 paid users we had was using the product every single day to keep their time, then they would have had no issue with putting their credit card down again. That was far from the truth though.', 'The first product challenge we faced was our on-boarding flow.', 'In the early days, here is what you needed to do to get up and running with Tali:', 'After you got through all of that, you could start to use Tali! As you can see though, it required multiple steps and logins with different applications, so a lot of the users that initially signed up for Tali never even got their account setup, and therefore never logged an activity through our app.', 'The second product challenge we faced impacted the user experience.', 'So, if you were one of the lucky ones that made it through the complicated on-boarding flow mentioned above, you then encountered a user experience issue related to the invocation name for our app, Tali (pronounced “tally”).', 'Turns out that tali is an actual word (it’s the plural of talus), which you pronounce “tail — eye”, something we didn’t know when we named our company. Turns out this presented some challenges. We kept getting feedback from users that Tali would not respond when they said “tally”, and instead would only work when they said “tail-eye.”', 'Again, to state the obvious, this caused MAJOR issues with the user experience. Turns out this was an Alexa platform issue, one we couldn’t correct on our own, so Matt AW, head of product at Tali, spent months weaving his way through the Amazon Alexa support process before finally getting the issue resolved. The damage was done though — for months we would get support requests from people on this issue, and we had to tell them to say “tail-eye” while we tried to get things resolved with Amazon.', 'Fundraising sucks. It was the least favorite part of my job, but something I had to do to keep the team in tact and dedicated full time to Tali.', 'I heard “no” from 99% of my investor conversations — “you’re too early” were three words I heard often.', 'People laughed at me — “you’re going to put a listening device in the office of an attorney? Ha!”', 'Some rolled their eyes at me — “ugh, you’re raising on a SAFE? That’s such a California thing.”', 'That said, I did develop some incredible relationships through the fundraising process, and I also learned how to craft a pitch and tell a story, another invaluable lesson.', 'We received our first investment in June 2017. We essentially had a rolling pre-seed round open, and would collect one check here, another check there as time went on (rather than raising one lump sum). In total, I raised nearly $1.0M for Tali over the course of 1.5yrs, all on a SAFE or convertible note (typical terms were a 15% — 20% discount and a $3.5M — $4.0M valuation cap).', 'During this time, we nearly ran out of money on three separate occasions. This is a problem every startup faces, so nothing unique here, and each time our bank account nearly hit $0 we always had something else hit — follow on from existing investors, capital from new investors, or even a $100k check for winning a pitch competition.', 'Things eventually stopped hitting though, and the last time we ran out of money, we went out of business.', 'We had some hiccups early on, every startup does, but we continued to grind away throughout 2018, and what a grind it was.', 'The first thing my two co-founders, Matt AW (also known as AW) and Matt Hoiland (also known as Hoi), did in early 2018 was fix the on-boarding issue. We ended up engineering our own flow so a user could create a Tali account and link their Alexa account all without leaving the Tali app. No need to go through the Alexa app, navigate several screens and link your accounts manually. This had a HUGE impact on the number of new signups that became activated accounts (e.g. those new users that eventually logged an activity).', 'The next thing was improving the user experience. AW hounded Amazon and managed to get our invocation issue fixed, so our Alexa skill was back on track. We then added Google Assistant functionality as well, and continued to iterate and experiment with a variety of interaction models to see what, if anything, would improve the user experience and increase engagement. We also released a V2 of the Tali dashboard, and added “fuzzy matching”, which improved the accuracy of Tali matching what you said to the correct client or project name.', 'These may sound like simple things, but they required a big engineering and product lift, which all landed squarely on the shoulders of AW and Hoi — in short, this was no easy task but they managed to do some absolutely amazing things.', 'Everything we did had a positive impact on user experience and engagement, but nothing really moved the needle. Our average daily active users (DAU) crept up, but was never greater than 10% of our total paid user base. We were able to get a lot more people activated because of the on-boarding improvements AW and Hoi made, but our free trial to paid conversion rate (those users that started with a free 30 day trial and then converted to a paid subscriber) never rose above 3.0%.', 'We were growing our paid user base each month, but growth was slow (only 10% — 15%) and driven mostly by direct sales efforts (which meant unsustainable unit economics). We even reduced the price from $30/user/month to $12/user/month to see if this would help drive sales, but it didn’t. We ended 2018 with around 250 paid users, more than we had at the end of 2017, but because of our price reduction our MRR remained flat at roughly $3k.', 'By December 2018 I knew we were in trouble. At this point, I had raised nearly $1.0M and we had 2.5 months of runway left.', 'I went to our current investors to ask for another follow on, and they all said no.', 'I tried to find angel investors that would write some smaller checks, and they all said no.', 'I even tried to find some later stage investors that would write a larger check, but they all said no too.', 'We weren’t going to grow our way out of this problem, and we weren’t going get additional capital either, which left us with two options — put things in cruise control or zombie mode, or shut things down.', 'I think the most difficult part in this process was simply admitting the fact that shutting things down was an option. As an entrepreneur, you need to solve your way out of a lot of problems and the odds are always stacked against you. So how do you know if this is just another one of those things you need to plow through, or if it’s different? Here’s what I did.', 'Talk to your mentors', 'My initial thought was we would just put things on hold at Tali for a while until we figured out what was next. We’d keep the technology up and running, do support requests and demos as needed, but would otherwise do as little as needed to keep the lights on. Myself and my team would go and get day jobs to pay our bills, and once we “turned the corner” with Tali we would jump back in full time. Sounds like a great plan, right?', 'Turns out, not so much.', 'I wasn’t able to admit that shutting things down was an option until I spoke to two of my mentors. Both had founded multiple companies in their lifetimes, some succeeded but most failed. They gave me the same advice — putting things in zombie mode is a dumb idea. “Give this thing everything you have over the next few weeks, and you’ll either go out in a blaze of glory or you’ll turn things around. Anything in between is not a viable option.”', 'With these conversations, zombie mode was off the table, and we were either going to turn things around or shut things down. Because of these conversations, I was finally able to admit shutting down was an option, and actually say the words out loud. Doing this was incredibly freeing, and took a huge weight off my chest.', 'Consider and reflect on everything you’ve done', 'After I spoke to my mentors, I went to the drawing board to reflect on everything we did up to that point and asked myself “is there anything I’m missing or anything I haven’t tried?” I looked at this mostly through the lens of our go-to-market and growth strategy, but also considered our product approach.', 'I tried outbound sales, but unit economics were not sustainable.', 'I tried digital marketing, but results were poor.', 'I tried Google Adwords and SEM, but this was expensive and conversion rates were low.', 'I put reseller agreements in place with technology partners, but these weren’t driving any volume.', 'Blogging, webinars, etc. all produced the same results — nothing seemed to be working.', 'I even went to other startup founders, asking them if they had any recommendations or tactics I could try. All of their ideas were things I had already experimented with, which didn’t yield positive results.', 'Then I looked at the numbers, and realized that, at our average growth rate, it would take us 26 months to reach cash flow positive at our current burn rate. How on earth would we even make that happen if we got day jobs and were focusing LESS on the business?', 'Is a “one-step” pivot viable?', 'By “one-step pivot”, I mean keeping one foot planted on the ground while lifting the other and moving it in a different direction (versus a two step pivot of lifting both feet off the ground and completely jumping in a different direction).', 'Up to this point our strategy was to be a horizontal SaaS company, one that was building a time and billing solution that could enter other industries outside of legal, rather than building a vertical SaaS solution just for attorneys. However, since we launched our product we had a long list of feature requests from our attorney users that were not focused on time and billing — things like taking notes, adding calendar entries, and assigning tasks, to name a few.', 'We hadn’t prioritized these legal specific things before, but could we build and launch any of them within the timeframe we had left? It sounded like a one-step pivot — we were still focused on voice technology for our existing core user, but would expand our use case to go beyond time and deep within legal (something we hadn’t previously planned).', 'Turns out this wasn’t a viable option, at least not with the time (or money) we had left. Are there any options left?', 'Can you sell?', 'We had spent nearly $1.0M and the last two years of our time building Tali. We had built a voice technology application for business that worked, something we believed (and still believe) will be core to future enterprise software products. So we asked ourselves — “would anyone want to buy what we’ve built?”', 'We had a few conversations, but nothing that ended up working out.', 'No more options', 'After I went through all of the options above, there was only one thing left — winding down. So that’s what we did — our attorneys started the legal process, and I notified all of our investors, partners and users to tell them that we’d be shutting down.', 'Winding down your company sucks.', 'At first, it hurts…really, really bad.', 'You get sad.', 'You get mad.', 'Sometimes, you get mad and sad at the same time.', 'Once you near the end of the wind down process, you feel empty, isolated and alone. After all, for the last two years I was a first-time founder and startup CEO, but once things are shut down, what am I? Who am I?', 'I don’t have the answers to these questions yet, but here is what I do know — it gets better, and you eventually get to a place where you’re proud of the company you built, and the decision to shut it down.', 'Most people don’t have the courage to start a company, to go through the grind of having the deck stacked against you every single day. Shutting a company down is the expected outcome for any new business, and it’s just one more challenging decision that you’ll likely have to make throughout your startup journey.', 'It’s a scar that you’ll have for the rest of your life, but a scar that should be worn proudly.', 'The other thing I took away from all of this is that while running Tali, and for the first time in my professional life, I felt truly energized and empowered. Up until that point, I was mostly going through the motions because I wasn’t really sure what I wanted to do, or what I could do.', 'That’s not the case anymore.', 'I know exactly what I want to do now, which is start more companies (will take a lot more than one failure to scare me away 😉) and be a part of more early stage startups.', 'And I know what I’m capable of, which turns out to be a lot more than I initially thought when I first started Tali.', 'There it is. That’s my story of what failure looks like, and what it feels like. I hope reading it was helpful to you, I know writing it was definitely cathartic for me.', 'I want to end this post by publicly thanking everyone who has been a part of the Tali journey.', 'To my wife, Kimberlee — you’ve been by my side since we were 14 years old, and were with me every step of the way with Tali for the last two years. Because of you, I had the confidence (and financial ability, thanks for being an employed lawyer) to jump head first into this adventure. It wasn’t easy on you, and I often took your support for granted. Thank you for always being there, and for putting up with a crazy spouse like me. Without you, none of this could have happened.', 'To my co-founders, AW and Hoiland — thank you for taking the risk of leaving your day jobs to start a company with me. You both are one of a kind and true unicorns 🦄, and have taught me so much. Before Tali, my gut told me you guys were special, and my experience with Tali has taught me that’s certainly the case.', 'To my investors, advisors and mentors — thank you for believing in me, and trusting me to fulfill the vision I had for Tali. At times, you had confidence in me when I didn’t believe in myself. Going through this journey with you has truly been a pleasure. Oh, and expect a call from me when I start my next venture 😉', 'To the Tali community — to put it simply, without you we’d be nothing. At every turn, your feedback shaped Tali’s development, and your passion signaled a new chapter for what it meant to track time. Together we talked through all the things you wanted in a timekeeping assistant, and dreamt of a world were you never had to fill out another time entry form again. Thank you for dreaming with us, and for helping to bring this reality into view.', 'To everyone else that supported Tali over the last two years — thank you as well.', 'And that’s it, the Tali chapter is officially closed, but with that another one opens. So what’s next?', 'Who knows, but want to build something together?']

Medium then distributes portions of that $5 across the articles each premium member reads/engages with.', 'In other words, Medium shares its revenue with its writers based on the engagement of the articles they publish. The higher the engagement (e.g, number of claps), the bigger the percentage of that $5 goes to a particular writer.', 'That’s why payments aren’t based on pageviews alone. A story can go viral but can fail to earn significant money if people don’t engage with it.', 'That’s also why gamifying the Medium algorithm will never work even though you manage to bring traffic somehow. You need real people, i.e., premium members who will actually read and engage with your articles.', 'To better understand this, below are stats from 4 random stories we published in The Startup last month, which have similar pageviews:', 'Engagement metrics such as read ratio, the number of fans, the number of claps obviously have an impact on Medium’s payout formula.', 'A few tips based on our insights so far:', 'We see many Medium writers trying to publish as many articles as they can, often at the cost of quality. Some authors even rush to publish multiple stories per day. It’s OK if you are able to bring together a top-notch story within a few minutes — for the rest of us, this isn’t a number game. Medium’s algorithm is designed to float only the best stories to the surface and their team is working hard to improve the system. Medium editors also review every single story that goes behind the paywall. A quality story 1) grabs the attention of Medium staff editors or publication editors like us 2) it then gets curated across the site such as on topic pages 3) and begins being distributed to a wider audience for maximum exposure.', 'There are two ways to get traffic to your Medium stories: on-Medium and off-Medium.', 'ON-MEDIUM traffic, as the term suggests, happens when people find your story on the Medium website or mobile app. They might be already browsing their homepage when you hit the publish button or be brought to your story through mobile (push) notifications. Not everybody ends up finding your story on their newsfeed, though. For such discovery to happen…', 'OFF-MEDIUM traffic happens outside Medium, i.e. when people receive your story via Medium’s weekly/daily digest emails or find it on Google search results, social media and other external sites (e.g., Hacker News).', 'Publications can help 1) float your stories to the top of Medium 2) grab the attention of Medium editors 3) reach an audience you wouldn’t reach otherwise. You can create your own publication or submit to The Startup here or to Medium’s other most-followed and active publications.', 'One of the things we observe with our writers is that they put too much pressure on maximizing their earnings. This leads to doing dangerous things to their writing, including rushing to publish as many articles as possible while compromising quality. Why not start small, ideally on the side? Take the time to find your style and test how the Medium Partner Program will work for you and scale at your own pace.', 'Big thanks to our writers who have shared their stats with us.', 'We hope these insights will be helpful to many other writers out there.', 'Thanks for reading.']

Microservices, from its core principles and in its true context, is a distributed system.', 'Transactions that span over multiple physical systems or computers over the network, are simply termed Distributed Transactions. In the world of microservices a transaction is now distributed to multiple services that are called in a sequence to complete the entire transaction.', 'Here is a monolithic e-commerce system using transactions:', 'In the system above, if a user sends a Checkout request to the platform, the platform will create a local database transaction that works over multiple database tables, to Process the order and Reserve items from the inventory. If any step fails, the transaction can roll back, both the order and items reserved. This is known as ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), which is guaranteed by the database system.', 'Here is the e-commerce system decomposed as microservices:', 'When we decompose this system, we created the microservices OrderMicroservice and InventoryMicroservice, which have separate databases. When a Checkout request comes from the user, both these microservices will be invoked to apply changes into their own database. Because the transaction is now across multiple databases via multiple systems, it is now considered a distributed transaction.', 'With the advent of microservice architecture we are losing the ACID nature of databases. Transactions may now span multiple microservices and therefore databases. The key problems we would face are:', 'Atomicity means that in a transaction either all steps are completed or no step is completed. In the example above, if the ‘reserve items’ in the InventoryMicroservice method fails, how do we roll back the ‘process order’ changes that were applied by the OrderMicroservice?', 'If an object from any one of the microservice is being persisted to the database and at the same time, another request reads the same object. Should the service return the old data or new ? In the example above, once OrderMicroservice is complete and the InventoryMicroservice is now performing its update, should requests for number of orders placed by the customer include the current order?', 'Today systems are designed for failures and some of the main problems faced is handling distributed transactions, to quote Pat Helland.', 'In general, application developers simply do not implement large scalable applications assuming distributed transactions. — Pat Helland', 'The above two problems are pretty crucial while designing and building microservice based applications. To address them the following list of approaches have been described:', 'As the name suggests, this way of handling transactions has two stages, a prepare phase and a commit phase. One important participant is the Transaction Coordinator which maintains the lifecycle of the transaction.', 'How it works:', 'In the prepare phase, all microservices involved prepare for commit and notify the coordinator that they are ready to complete the transaction. Then in the commit phase, either a commit or a rollback command is issued by the transaction coordinator to all microservices.', 'Lets take the e-commerce system as an example:', 'In the example above (image 3), when a user sends a checkout request the TransactionCoordinator will first begin a global transaction with all the context information. First it will send out a prepare command to the OrderMicroservice, to create an order. Then it will send out a prepare command to the InventoryMicroservice, to reserve the items. When both the services are OK to perform the change, they lock down the objects from further changes and notify the TransactionCoordinator. Once the TransactionCoordinator has confirmed that all microservices are ready to apply their changes, it will then ask them to persist their changes by requesting a commit with the transaction. At this point, all objects will be unlocked.', 'In a failure scenario (image 4) - if at any point a single microservice fails to prepare, the TransactionCoordinator will abort the transaction and begin the rollback process. In the diagram, the OrderMicroservice failed to create an order for some reason, but the InventoryMicroservice has replied that it is prepared to create the order. The TransactionCoordinator will request an abort on the InventoryMicroservice and the service will then roll back any changes made and unlock the database objects.', 'Advantages', 'Dis-Advantages', 'One of the best definitions of eventual consistency, is described on microservices.io: Each service publishes an event whenever it updates its data. Other service subscribe to events. When an event is received, a service updates its data.', 'In this approach, the distributed transaction is fulfilled by asynchronous local transactions on related microservices. The microservices communicate with each other through an event bus.', 'How it works:', 'Again, lets take the e-commerce system as an example:', 'In the example above (image 5), the client requests the system to Process The Order. On this request the Choreographer emits an event Create Order, marking the start of the transaction. The OrderMicroservice listens to this event and creates an order, if it was successful it emits an Order Created event. The Choreographer listens for this event and proceeds to reserve the items, by emitting the Reserve Items event. The InventoryMicroservice listens for this event and reserve’s the items, if it was successful it emits an Items Reserved event. Which in this example means the end of the transaction.', 'All the event based communication between microservices happen via the Event Bus and is Choreographed by another system to address the complexity issue.', 'If for any reason the InventoryMicroservice failed to reserve the items (image 6), it emits a Failed to Reserve Items event. The Choreographer listens for this event and starts a Compensating Transaction, by emitting a Delete Order event. The OrderMicroservice listens to this event and deletes the order that was created.', 'Advantages', 'One big advantage of this approach is that each microservice focuses only on its own atomic transaction. Microservice’s are not blocked if another service is taking a longer time. This also means that there is no database lock required. Using this approach makes the system highly scalable under heavy load, due to its asynchronous event based solution.', 'Dis-Advantages', 'The main disadvantage, is the approach does not have read isolation. Which means, in the above example the client could see the order was created, but in the next second, the order is removed due to a compensating transaction. Also, when the number of microservices increase it becomes harder to debug and maintain.', 'First alternative is to avoid needing distributed transactions. If it is a new application being built, start with a monolith as described in MonolithFirst by Martin Fowler. To quote a section, from the page.', 'A more common approach is to start with a monolith and gradually peel off microservices at the edges. Such an approach can leave a substantial monolith at the heart of the microservices architecture, but with most new development occurring in the microservices while the monolith is relatively quiescent. — Martin Fowler', 'When there is a need to update data in two places as a result of one event, Eventual Consistency / SAGA approach is a preferable way of handling distributed transactions as compared to the two-phase commit. The main reason being two-phase commit does not scale in a distributed environment. The Eventual Consistency approach also introduces a new set of problems, such as how to atomically update the database and emit an event. Adoption of this approach requires a change in mindset for both development and testing teams.']

06/2019	Why Let’s Encrypt is a really, really, really bad idea…	Did I mention it is a really bad idea???	4.5K	89	https://medium.com/@johnhorst67	https://medium.com/swlh/why-lets-encrypt-is-a-really-really-really-bad-idea-d69308887801?source=collection_archive---------1-----------------------	5	1	['Why Let’s Encrypt is a really, really, really bad idea…']	23	['UPDATE: When you’re done reading this, make sure to read my answer to my many critics. This also provoked a well-written response. In turn, I explain the value of an Extended Value SSL/TLS certificate.', 'Your web site’s ability to rank in Google search results is now a function of whether you use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Or to put it another way, whether you have it addressed at an URL starting with “https”.', 'In an effort to promote the use of SSL across the web, industry participants have formed Let’s Encrypt, a service provided by the Internet Security Research Group. The service has taken off, with major hosting providers creating tools to automatically create SSL certificates and install them on hosted sites. Sounds like an advance in cyber security, right?', 'Uh…, maybe not?', 'The heart of encryption is the encrypting key. Imagine for a moment you have a real-world lock big and strong enough to withstand a 50 caliber rifle shot. What good is that if the bad guy ends up with the key? The digital analogy is the cipher strength of the certificate used to encrypt your website’s traffic. To apply the 50 caliber rifle shot analogy, if the bad guy gets a hold of the “private key” used to generate the SSL certificate, the size of the cipher is rendered entirely irrelevant.', 'There are numerous Certificate Authorities (CAs) which sell SSL certificates. Each has its own externally audited “Key Management System” (KMS). These CAs submit their audits to the major Operating System vendors like Microsoft, Apple, and Google in order to get their “root certificates” in the OS’s “trusted certificates” store. This is what makes their website SSL certificates work when someone with, say, a Mac navigates to your site.', 'From a security standpoint, the market fragmentation of CAs is a feature, not a bug.', 'Medium.com’s SSL certificate was issued by DigiCert (and will expire in August — heads up Medium!). If DigiCert’s Key Management System is compromised, all of their SSL certificates will have to be revoked and re-issued. But if one of the other CAs is compromised, it would not affect Medium’s site.', 'Let’s Encrypt is an example where the “convenience” of automated issuance of “free” SSL certificates is a bug, not a feature.', 'The more sites secured by Let’s Encrypt certificates, the bigger the threat surface becomes because the compromise of Let’s Encrypt’s KMS could potentially affect a large number of sites. Let’s Encrypt is being chosen right now because it is a “fire and forget” solution for encrypting site traffic. If a site certificate is revoked, and no one is paying attention to this possibility, traffic will drop precipitously and you as a business person may well be no the wiser for why your lead generation dried up. (Certificate expiration, with no one paying attention, is why no one at Equifax knew they had been hacked for months.)', '“Fire and forget” might not be a particularly good idea in cyber security. Just sayin’…', 'To understand why this matters, imagine you could position yourself in the middle between a company’s website and their customers or visitors. You can suck up all of that traffic — and if you have the private keys from a CA like Let’s Encrypt you can decrypt the traffic from sites using their certificates. But that’s not the worst of it: Your place as a “man in the middle” cannot be detected by traditional scanning. You’re not necessarily in the network hosting the site and you’re not in the customer/visitor’s computer. But you are in the middle — undetectable and with the keys to the kingdom.', 'How would you get there? The easiest and most likely way has little at all to do with technology. You just manage to plant an insider into the CA’s division that administers its Key Management System.', 'The insider threat applies to all Certificate Authorities — but not equally, from a cyber security point of view. Let’s ask this general question:', 'Who loses what if a CA’s KMS is compromised?', 'Prior to Let’s Encrypt the answer would be the CA’s ownership loses reputation and business. If the CA was run by a publicly held company, investors lose value in their portfolio and the company would likely be exposed to shareholder lawsuits. Management would likely be fired.', 'Let’s ask the same question of Let’s Encrypt: Who loses what?', 'There are no “owners;” this is a not-for-profit organization. There is no revenue; the SSL certs are free.', 'Nobody loses anything; there is no “skin in the game.”', 'As more business is done on the web, business people would like there to be a “fire and forget” solution for protecting the confidentiality of their customers’ data. The hard truth is no such solution exists. So what are startups and other small businesses to do?', 'First: Avoid the temptation of “free” and “convenient.” Major SSL Certificate Authorities have tools you can use, or have your computer support person use, to issue your site’s SSL certificate. They also offer installation support, as do major hosting companies. There’s a process to verify you own the domain, but it not unreasonably cumbersome. Pay attention especially to the breach insurance they offer as part of their product.', 'Second: If your site is hosted by a hosting company, pay careful attention to the hosting agreement when it comes to who is responsible for what in terms of securing your site. You will likely need to use their tools to create the “certificate signing request” (CSR). Your CA will require the CSR to generate the certificate.', 'Third: If you contract out the site development and maintenance, ask the provider if they carry cyber insurance. (This is probably the biggest reason to avoid off-shoring this kind of work.) Require them to provide you proof of coverage in case their “errors and omissions” causes your site to be breached.']

We will be using Node.js/Express and MongoDB. We shall use MongoDB Atlas, a cloud database service that hosts MongoDB databases to store our data. You can always set up a local MongoDB database however, I will not be talking about installing and configuring a MongoDB database locally in this tutorial.', 'If you’re mostly interested in the code. Find the repo here.', 'Learning prerequisites', 'Outline', 'Below is an outline of the steps we will take to accomplish this task. At the end of this tutorial, you should be able to easily include basic authentication and authorization in your Node.js projects.', 'Step 1: Create a MongoDB database on MongoDB Atlas', 'Head over to MongoDB Atlas and click on Start free to create an account. After creating an account, you will be welcomed with a modal like the one in figure 1 below.', 'Click on the Build my first cluster button and then you will be asked to choose the cloud provider and the region nearest to you. It’s important to note that behind the scene, MongoDB Atlas uses Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform or Azure. For the cloud provider, we shall maintain the default option AWS and for the region, we shall select the nearest free tier. For my case, I will choose Frankfurt(eu-central-1) tier because it’s the closet region to me. Leave the other settings as they are and click theCreate Cluster button at the very bottom-right of the page.', 'The cluster creation will take between 7–10 minutes to complete. You will notice a pop-up window in the left-bottom that shows a list of tasks to accomplish. Minimize the pop-up window and let’s continue.', 'After the cluster has been created, click on theCONNECT button to create a database connection. A pop-up window like the one below will be displayed.', 'Click on the Add a Different IP Address button and in the IP Address text field enter the following IP 0.0.0.0/0 which will whitelist all IPs and allow access of your database from anywhere, then click the Add IP Address button. Still, on the same page, enter a username and password. Make sure you keep a note of those credentials because we shall need them to connect to that database. Click on theCreate MongoDB User button and then click the choose a connection method button. Finally, choose the Connect Your Application option. Ensure that in the driver drop-down, Node.js is selected. Copy the connection string at the bottom and paste it somewhere for now. We shall use it in our application to connect to the database.', 'Finally, our database set up is done and it’s time to set up our project structure.', 'Step 2: Setup a file structure for the project', 'Now that our database is well set up, we can go ahead and create our project. Create a folder anywhere on your computer and name it. I’ve named mine user-registration-api . You can decide to name yours differently. Go ahead and set up a file structure like the one below.', 'From the above file structure, you will realize that we have a root folder called src and inside it, we have an app.js file. This is where we shall define our express server. We also have 4 folders inside src whose names are descriptive of the files we are creating in there. The models folder will contain all the models and for this project, it will just be the User model. The db folder shall contain our database connection, the routers folder shall contain our user routes, and finally, the middleware folder shall contain all our middleware. For this project, we shall be creating one middleware called auth which will help us to set up protected endpoints.', ""Let's start by opening our project in a text editor. I will be using VS-Code for this project but you can use your own favorite text editor if you have one. Before we start, make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. If not, navigate to nodejs.org, download and install the latest version of node. After it’s been installed, open your terminal and type the command node -v and hit enter. This should print out the version of Node you have installed on your computer."", 'Once installed, Node.js comes with its package manager npm. Still on the terminal. Type npm -v to confirm that you have npm installed. This command should print the version of npm installed. NPM is used to install and manage all the packages in a node project but there are other Package managers that you can use and one of the popular ones is yarn which I personally find easier to use and will be using in this project.', 'To install yarn on windows, just head over to your terminal and type npm install yarn -g. For Mac and Linux users, type sudo npm install yarn -g . This will prompt you for your computer password. Provide it and hit enter.', 'Once that’s done, still, on your terminal, navigate to your project root folder and type yarn init to initialize our node project. This will provide you with a series of questions that you can navigate through by just hitting enter to accept the default options. This process will create a package.json file which will list all the packages our project depends on.', 'Step 3: Install all the required NPM packages', 'Our project will need a number of npm packages and below is the list of those packages and a brief explanation of what each of those packages will help us achieve.', ""Now that we know what each of those packages will do, let's go ahead and install them. In your terminal, make sure that you’re still in the root directory of your project, type the following command yarn add express mongodb mongoose bcryptjs validator jsonwebtoken . This command will install all those packages and add them among our dependencies in the package.js file. Let’s also add nodemon, and env-cmd as development dependencies by running the command yarn add env-cmd nodemon --dev."", 'Before we go to the next step, let’s first include an environment file where we shall define our environment variables. In the root folder, on the same level with the src folder, create a .env file.', 'Open package.json and add the following script just after the main:index.js line. ""scripts"":{""start"" : ""env-cmd -f ./.env nodemon src/app.js""} . This means that every time we run the command yarn start , we’ll use nodemon to serve our server that’s defined in src/app.js and we will use our environment variables defined in the .env file.', 'Step 4: Define the environment variables', 'Open the .env file and add the following environment variables.', ""The MONGODB_URL variable holds the connection string that we got after configuring our MongoDB on MongoDB Atlas. Remember the string I asked you to copy and paste somewhere. You will notice that my connection string has a database username that I provided — fatukunda . This should be different from yours. The <password> portion should be replaced with the password you chose when you created the database user. Also, let's replace the database name test to user-registration-db"", 'The JWT_KEY variable will hold our JWT token key that we shall use to create the user authentication token and the PORT variable contains a port number where our app will be running.', 'Step 5: Create an express server', 'Head over to app.js and type the following code.', 'In the above code snippet, we load express into our file, we then require the user router that we shall create later, and we set our port number to be the number in the PORT environment variable and we then require the db.js file that has our database connection which we shall create shortly. We then create an express() instance and assign it to app . Since we are going to be building an API, we are going to expect our requests to parse the data that we send and receive from the server to be in json format. If you’re not familiar with JSON , please learn more here. The express instance gives us methods like get, post, delete, patch that we use to send HTTP requests to the server.', 'Go to your terminal and type the command yarn start . You should be seeingServer running on port 3000 on your terminal. That means we’ve successfully set up our express server.', 'Step 6: Connect to the database', 'Go to db/db.js file and type the code below.', 'In the code above, we are requiring mongoose into our file and using the mongoose connect method which takes in the database URL as one of its parameters and an object of options as the second parameter. We should understand that mongoose uses the MongoDB driver behind the scenes and there are several deprecations in the MongoDB driver that mongoose users should be aware of and cater for in order to avoid deprecation warnings from popping up into their console. We, therefore, supply the useNewUrlParser and useCreateIndex to avoid such deprecation warnings. A full list of deprecation warnings in MongoDB driver that you should be aware of when using mongoose can be found here. That’s all we will need to create our connection to the database.', 'Step 7: Create the User Model', 'Now it’s time to define our user model. Head over to /models/User.js file and type the following code.', 'From line 1 to line 4, we load in the required packages and on line 6 , we create our mongoose schema which takes in an object. This object defines the different properties of the user schema. Mongoose will convert our user schema into a document in the database and those properties will be converted into fields in our document. As you might have noticed, when we define the properties, we also define their characteristics for example whether they are required or not, their types, whether they are unique or not and whether they should be lowercase or not. Mongoose provides us with all these options that you can easily define on your properties. We, for example, want the emails to be unique and to be in lowercase . The validate function helps us make some more validations on our schemas. We are using the validator package to easily define validations that would have taken us many lines of code to write. The validator package provides a number of functions like isEmail which validates if a given string is a valid email and many more. Learn more about validator from here.', 'We shall also store a list of tokens in our database. Every time a user registers or logs in, we shall create a token and append it to the existing list of tokens. Having a list of tokens enables a user to be logged in on different devices and once they log out of one device, we still want to make sure that they are still logged in on another device that they had logged in.', 'From line 36 to 43, we define a pre-save function that the mongoose schema provides us. This enables us to do something before we save the created object. As you can see, we are trying to hash the password before saving the object. Ideally, you shouldn’t be saving passwords in a raw format. They should be properly hashed. We are using bcrypt to hash the password. We want to make sure that we only hash the password if it’s modified and that’s why we have to first check if the password was modified.', 'Mongoose also enables us to define both instance and model methods. Model methods are methods defined on the model and can be created by using the schema statics whereas instance methods just like their name suggests are defined on the document/instance. From, line 45 to 52 , we define an instance method called generateAuthToken . This method uses the JWT to sign method to create a token. The sign method expects the data that will be used to sign the token and a JWT key which can be a random string. For our case, we defined one in the .env file and named it JWT_KEY . Once the token is created, we add it to the user’s list of tokens, save, and return the token.', 'From, line 54 to 65, we define a model method called findByCredentials which expects two parameters, the user email, and password. on, line 66 we search for a user with the given email using the mongoose find method. If the user is not available, we throw an error to let the user know that the credentials they provided are invalid. If the email exists, we then compare the received password with the stored hashed password and if they match, we return that user. We shall use this function to log users into the application.', 'Finally, on, line 67 , we create a model called User and pass it our created user schema and we then export the module so that it can be re-used in other files.', 'Section 8: Create the necessary routes', 'It’s finally time to create our different routes. Below is the list of endpoints we shall be creating.', 'Let’s start with creating users router. Head over to /routers/user.js and write the following code.', 'In the code snippet above, we are creating two routers. The POST /users router to create a new user and the POST /users/login router to log in a registered user.', 'The user registration router creates a new user along with the given user information that we access from the req.body. After saving the user, we generate an authentication token and return it as a response alongside the user data. In order to test if our router works as expected, we are going to install postman — An API development environment. Once postman is installed. Boot it up and go ahead to write your first request.', 'Make sure that the type of request being sent is a POST request and ensure that the URL is localhost:3000/users . Select the raw radio button and the JSON(application/json) on the type of data. Provide the required fields which are name, email and password like we defined them in our user model. Before you hit the Send button, make sure that your server is running. If not, type the command yarn start on your terminal. Hit send on Postman and if everything went well, you should have an output similar to the one I have in figure 5 above.', 'Test the POST /users/login route by changing the URL and body options. This time provide the email and password . Hit send and if all went well, you should receive a response similar to the one in figure 6 below.', 'Section 9: Create the auth middleware', 'Middleware is a software/ piece of code that acts as a bridge between the database and the application, especially on a network. For the case of this project, we want to ensure that when a request is sent to the server, some code(middleware) is run before the request hits the server and returns a response. We want to check if a person who is trying to access a specific resource is authorized to access it.', 'Head over to /middleware/auth.js and write the following code.', ""An express middleware is simply a function with three parameters, the request, response and next . On, line 5, we get the token from the request header and since the token comes in a format of, Bearer[space]token we are replacing Bearer[space] with nothing('') so that we can have access to our token. Once we have the token, we use the JWT verify method to check if the token received is valid or was created using our JWT_KEY . The JWT verify method returns the payload that was used to create the token. Now since we have the payload from the token, we can now find a user with that id and also if the token is in the user’s tokens array. Once we find that user, we attach the user on our request (req.user = user) and then do the same for the token then call next() to go to the next middleware. If next() is not called, the application will freeze at that point and won’t proceed to run the rest of the code."", 'Now to use our auth middleware, we are going to go back to /routers/user.js, import our auth middleware by requiring it at the top of the file just after requiring the user model. The following line of code should do it. const auth = require(../middleware/auth) , then create another router to get the user profile. Add the following code right after the login endpoint.', 'Just 2 lines of code and you get the user profile. On, line 1, I make a get request to the /users/me endpoint and then I pass in my auth middleware just before the method. This will ensure that the middleware is run before executing the rest of my function. On, line 3, I simply get the user profile from the request(Remember I added the user to the request in my middleware and since my middleware will have already run at this point, I will have access to the user in my request) and send it back as my response. Let’s test it out using Postman. Go to postman and head over to GET/users/me, provide an authentication token and send out the request. You should have a response similar to the one below if all went well.', 'Notice the Authorization tab is selected and in there, Bearer Token is chosen from the drop-down and on the right, a token is provided. You can use the token that you receive after login.', 'Section 10: Logout/Logout all', 'In this last section, we shall write two routes for log out and log out all. Logout all will log out the user from all the devices they are signed in.', 'Now, let’s go back to /routers/user.js and create 2 other routes. Just after the user profile route. Type the following code.', 'In the code above, the first route /users/me/logout , we filter the user’s tokens array and return true if any of the tokens is not equal to the token that was used by the user to login. The array filter method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented. In our case above, the filter method will return a new array that contains any other tokens apart from the one that was used to log in. If we, therefore, try to get the user profile, we should be denied access since we are no longer logged in. Read more about the filter method from here.', 'Head over to postman, first, login, get the token from the response, then head over to /users/me/logout and use that token as the Bearer Token. Hit send. A 200 response code should be returned. Now go to /users/me and try to access your profile using the same token that you used to log out. An error response should be returned like the one in figure 8 below.', 'In the 2nd route, /users/me/logoutall, we use the splice array method to remove tokens from the user’s tokens array. We then save the user document. To test this endpoint, let’s head over to Postman visit the /users/login endpoint. Let’s login 3 times. After that, head over to /users/me view the user profile. You will notice that you now have 3 tokens in the tokens array. Now go to /users/me/logoutall . This will clear the tokens array which means if you now navigate to /users/me again, you shouldn’t be able to view the user profile. Read more about the splice array method from here.', 'Step 11: Conclusion', 'We’ve come a long way but I hope you’ve been able to learn something from this tutorial.

If you are unfamiliar with the Transformer model (or if words like “attention”, “embeddings”, and “encoder-decoder” sound scary), check out this brilliant article by Jay Alammar. You don’t necessarily need to know everything about BERT (or Transformers) to follow the rest of this guide, but the above links should help if you wish to learn more about BERT and Transformers.', 'Now that we’ve gotten what we won’t do out of the way, let’s dig into what we will do, shall we?', 'One last thing before we dig in, I’ll be using three Jupyter Notebooks for data preparation, training, and evaluation. It’s not strictly necessary, but it felt cleaner to separate those three processes.', 'Most datasets you find will typically come in the csv format and the Yelp Reviews dataset is no exception. Let’s load it in with pandas and take a look.', 'As you can see, the data is in the two csv files train.csv and test.csv. They contain no headers, and two columns for the label and the text. The labels used here feel a little weird to me, as they have used 1 and 2 instead of the typical 0 and 1. Here, a label of 1 means the review is bad, and a label of 2 means the review is good. I’m going to change this to the more familiar 0 and 1 labelling, where a label 0 indicates a bad review, and a label 1 indicates a good review.', 'BERT, however, wants data to be in a tsv file with a specific format as given below (Four columns, and no header row).', 'Let’s make things a little BERT-friendly.', 'For convenience, I’ve named the test data as dev data. The convenience stems from the fact that BERT comes with data loading classes that expects train and dev files in the above format. We can use the train data to train our model, and the dev data to evaluate its performance. BERT’s data loading classes can also use a test file but it expects the test file to be unlabelled. Therefore, I will be using the train and dev files instead.', 'Now that we have the data in the correct form, all we need to do is to save the train and dev data as .tsv files.', 'That’s the eggs beaten, the chicken thawed, and the veggies sliced. Let’s get cooking!', 'Now, we will see the reason for us rearranging the data into the .tsv format in the previous section. It enables us to easily reuse the example classes that come with BERT for our own binary classification task. Here’s how they look.', 'The first class, InputExample, is the format that a single example of our dataset should be in. We won’t be using the text_b attribute since that is not necessary for our binary classification task. The other attributes should be fairly self-explanatory.', 'The other two classes, DataProcessor and BinaryClassificationProcessor, are helper classes that can be used to read in .tsv files and prepare them to be converted into features that will ultimately be fed into the actual BERT model.', 'The BinaryClassificationProcessor class can read in the train.tsv and dev.tsv files and convert them into lists of InputExample objects.', 'So far, we have the capability to read in tsv datasets and convert them into InputExample objects. BERT, being a neural network, cannot directly deal with text as we have in InputExample objects. The next step is to convert them into InputFeatures.', 'BERT has a constraint on the maximum length of a sequence after tokenizing. For any BERT model, the maximum sequence length after tokenization is 512. But we can set any sequence length equal to or below this value. For faster training, I’ll be using 128 as the maximum sequence length. A bigger number may give better results if there are sequences longer than this value.', 'An InputFeature consists of purely numerical data (with the proper sequence lengths) that can then be fed into the BERT model. This is prepared by tokenizing the text of each example and truncating the longer sequence while padding the shorter sequences to the given maximum sequence length (128). I found the conversion of InputExample objects to InputFeature objects to be quite slow by default, so I modified the conversion code to utilize the multiprocessing library of Python to significantly speed up the process.', 'We will see how to use these methods in just a bit.', '(Note: I’m switching to the training notebook.)', 'First, let’s import all the packages that we’ll need, and then get our paths straightened out.', 'In the first cell, we are importing the necessary packages. In the next cell, we are setting some paths for where files should be stored and where certain files can be found. We are also setting some configuration options for the BERT model. Finally, we will create the directories if they do not already exist.', 'Next, we will use our BinaryClassificationProcessor to load in the data, and get everything ready for the tokenization step.', 'Here, we are creating our BinaryClassificationProcessor and using it to load in the train examples. Then, we are setting some variables that we’ll use while training the model. Next, we are loading the pretrained tokenizer by BERT. In this case, we’ll be using the bert-base-cased model.', 'The convert_example_to_feature function expects a tuple containing an example, the label map, the maximum sequence length, a tokenizer, and the output mode. So lastly, we will create an examples list ready to be processed (tokenized, truncated/padded, and turned into InputFeatures) by the convert_example_to_feature function.', 'Now, we can use the multi-core goodness of modern CPU’s to process the examples (relatively) quickly. My Ryzen 7 2700x took about one and a half hours for this part.', '(Note: If you have any issues getting the multiprocessing to work, just copy paste all the code up to, and including, the multiprocessing into a python script and run it from the command line or an IDE. Jupyter Notebooks can sometimes get a little iffy with multiprocessing.

Next time, you can just unpickle the file to get the list of features.', 'Well, that was a lot of data preparation. You deserve a coffee, I’ll see you for the training part in a bit.

But it definitely isn’t something offered on a consistent basis.', 'Are you more of a creative type? If you love to write stories, you should consider self-publishing on Amazon. You might think getting a book published would be a complicated process, but it really isn’t.', 'Using the Kindle Direct Publishing platform, they take care of all of the technical details. You upload your completed document, add a cover image and description, and Amazon takes care of the rest. Many people make a great side income by writing short stories. And the beauty of this is — once you have your book listed on Amazon, it will stay there for years to come, earning income with no additional work on your end.', 'If you watch prime time television, you may have seen the popular CBS show “Bull”, starring Michael Weatherly. It’s a courtroom drama about a trial-consulting firm that assembles mock juries to help predict potential trial outcomes. Sound interesting? Well, you can have the opportunity to do the same thing, entirely online.', 'eJury.com brings together online juries and focus groups to help attorneys develop their case strategies, based on valuable data and information that YOU provide. You can sign up to be an eJuror right on the website, and will be contacted once a qualifying case becomes available. A typical case consists of a written description — facts, diagrams, pictures, and questions. The average case study takes 35 minutes, and you are paid $5 — $10 per case, depending on length.', 'Affiliate marketing, if done correctly, is pretty much a “set it and forget it”. A certain amount of work is required up front, and then after that will be totally passive income. So what exactly is affiliate marketing? It’s basically when you vouch for a product or service, recommending it to others. And then that company offers you a reward for bringing in new customers. It could be a certain dollar amount, a free product, or a free service, depending on what the company sells. And it’s something everyone can do, even if you don’t have a blog or professional online presence.', 'I’m sure you’ve heard of cash back or refund programs like Ebates (aka Rakuten), where you get money back from making purchases online. But did you know you can also make money as an Ebates affiliate? You sign up through their affiliate program, and are given your own personal affiliate link. Then you promote your link on social media, or by email to family and friends, and yes, even on your blog, if you have one.', 'And for every person who signs up through your link with a qualifying sale, you will earn $25. That’s huge!', 'And it’s also why sooo many people promote Ebates online. It’s a heck of a lot easier to earn $25 referrals, than to actually earn $25 cash back after making online purchases.', 'Ebates has been officially renamed / rebranded to “Rakuten”, which means “ optimism “ in Japanese.', 'If you were to look at your phone right now, how many photos do you think would be on there? I just looked at mine, and I have 668 photos, plus 104 videos. Wouldn’t it be amazing if you could somehow make money on a few of these photos? I don’t mean by selling out your bestie, or posting a bunch of selfies online. But if you have high-quality photos (in focus, non-blurry) of outdoor scenes, foliage, nature, animals, flowers, sunsets — you name it — you can make money by selling them online.', 'Websites like Shutterstock, Pond5, iStock/Getty images, and Fotolia will pay you for your still pictures or stock footage (short video clips). Each company has its specific guidelines. But in general, they look for quality photos that are generic and seasonal, which others can then purchase for commercial or personal use through their website. Also, if there are people in your pics or footage, then a model release form also needs to be completed.', 'One of the quickest and easiest ways to sell a physical product online is through Print on Demand. This means you provide a design, and the POD company takes care of printing, shipping, and customer support. Merch by Amazon is the platform I recommend for getting started with POD, since it’s user friendly and extremely popular. I mean, everybody has shopped on Amazon one or two times, right?', 'To get started selling on Merch, all you need are a few creative ideas and an app to mock up your design. There are so many designing apps out there, accessible for computers and also for smartphones. Some free and popular programs are GIMP, Canva, Stencil, Over, and WordRabbit.', 'This next group of side hustle ideas can also be done from home, and are very close to being entirely passive. Some additional work may be involved, but something that can totally be handled while multitasking.', 'The only real work involved with this side hustle is washing and folding the gently used clothing you plan on selling online. ThredUp will mail a shipping bag and postage-paid shipping label right to you (in what they call a “Clean Out Kit”). You place all of the items in the bag, seal it, and schedule a free pickup from USPS or FedEx.', 'Upon receipt, ThredUp will inspect all of the items, determine prices, then list them for sale. And as each item is sold, you’ll receive the cash into your linked account. Which is way easier than listing individual items online on eBay, and then having to ship purchases to buyers yourself. ThredUp takes all of the grunt work out of the process for you.', 'This is something you need to remember to do, but it’s pretty quick & no thought is involved. The next time you spend a day grocery shopping or erranding, make sure you save those paper receipts! There are several smartphone apps where you can scan your receipts for cash. So remind everyone in your family to keep their receipts as well. I do this at home — everyone drops their paper receipts on the kitchen table, I scoop them up & scan into all of my apps.', 'Some of the most popular receipt scanning apps are Receipt Pal, Receipt Hog, and Fetch Rewards. You gain points for scanning paper receipts, and can also connect an email address to include email receipts from online purchases. Depending on how frequently you scan, it may take a few months before you can cash in. But again, this is such a low amount of effort. And you’re doing the shopping anyway, so already have the receipts. Instead of crumpling them in a ball and throwing them away, make them go a bit further for you and cash in.', 'How often do you use Google to search online? Once a day? Several times a day? Well, some companies will actually pay you for using their search engine. Two examples that immediately come to mind are Swagbucks and Bing. In fact, one of my peers uses Bing exclusively for searches, for the purpose of accumulating Bing Reward points.', 'He has teenagers who play video games on Xbox. And apparently you can use your reward points to pay for your Xbox Live monthly subscription. He said he’s used points to pay for an entire year of Xbox Live up front, and has done this for several years.', 'Now that’s impressive — solely from doing online searches that you’re going to do regardless. So instead of asking someone to “ Google it”, maybe instead say “ Bing it “!', 'Picky Domains is a site I’ve recently discovered, and have been trying out. I’m including it in this post because I thought it was such a fun concept, and I’d never heard of this side hustle idea. Customers sign up with Picky Domains when they are looking for brand name or domain name suggestions. They provide a short business background and lay out the parameters — like associated keywords, and maximum number of words or letters.', 'And as a Picky Domains contributor, you would suggest names that they might like. If the customer picks your suggestion, then you get paid between $20-$75, depending on the type of order. In addition, you can make a small amount of bonus money even if the customer likes your suggestion, but ultimately doesn’t select it. If you have a creative streak and are good with words, it should be easy to make dozens of suggestions for each company. Something you can totally do while watching TV at night, with really no effort involved.', 'If you are active on social media, whether it’s Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, or Pinterest, you may want to consider becoming an Amazon Influencer. This is slightly different from their affiliate program because as an Influencer, you get to create your own storefront on Amazon, with a custom Amazon URL. (With the Amazon affiliate program, you have a unique link to specific products that you place in other online locations.)', 'When you set up your storefront, you’re basically curating all of your favorite Amazon content to display in your store. And you can create separate Idea Lists, that serve as categories. For example, you can create an Idea List of Best Summer Reads, or Must-Have Hair Care Products, or Cutest Dog Halloween Costumes. Then you can share your Amazon storefront link wherever you have an audience or followers. And when customers shop through your storefront, you earn money on qualifying purchases.', 'Here are some side hustle ideas where you can make money from home, but may need to engage in a small amount of human interaction. Which wouldn’t be an everyday occurrence, but may happen every once in a while.', 'Online Focus Groups are a great way to make money from home for providing your opinion. They’re similar to online surveys, except they pay a lot more. Like, it wouldn’t be difficult to locate an opportunity where you can make from $50 — $200. But in general, you need to qualify for a particular demographic. So you more than likely will need to complete a short survey up front, to make sure you fit the criteria needed for the focus group. The focus group may take the form of an online community or forum, where they want you to post your opinion on something. Or a company may mail you a product to use, and then you need to tell them what you thought about it. It could even be a brand new smartphone app that they’d like you to try out & give your opinion on.', 'A lot of this communication will be done entirely online. But sometimes companies may offer phone interviews, where you need to talk to an actual person in order to answer questions. There are even in-person focus groups, like the ones you see on TV in car commercials. When you register with a research organization, you typically set your preferences — whether you prefer online, text, telephone, or in-person focus groups.', 'A few organizations where you can sign up for focus groups are Find Focus Groups, Survey Squad, and User Interviews.', 'Another not-so-common suggestion for working from home is to be a Census Taker. I know what you’re thinking — There’s no way I’m going door-to-door, counting everyone who lives in each house.', 'But hear me out.', 'That’s only one aspect of what the Census Team does. And I only know this because I actually got the chance to speak with a 2020 Census Recruiter a few weeks ago, when I attended a local ChooseFI meetup. So while they do have door-to-door Census Takers, there are also plenty of online research positions, where you can work from home, part-time. Basically, they train you how to use online tools to verify information. In certain situations, you may need to drive to a location and take a picture of a house or building. This would be in situations where they cannot validate that someone lives in a residence. For example, in the case of foreclosures or if a previous resident has passed away. But the majority of this verification can actually be done online.', 'If you check out their website, you can see the pay grade that applies to your location. In the county where I live, the pay would be $21 per hour — which is not bad at all, right?', 'These next few side hustle ideas require basically no effort, and produce totally passive income. But they may not be for everyone. They require a certain level of transparency, allowing these companies into your daily online behavior. So if you’re a little hesitant about “Big Brother” watching you, these may not be a good fit for you. However, if you don’t mind sharing a few of your online habits, you can cash in by receiving money for doing nothing.', 'And I will tell you, I currently participate in both of these. (But then again, my life isn’t terribly interesting, so they’re probably not discovering a ton of useful information!)', 'With Digital Reflection, you get paid for having a hardware device connected to your computer router. In addition, you earn bonus quarterly payments for validating any online devices used in your household (laptops, cell phones, tablets). According to the company website, they gather data to create research reports for businesses around the world, and the reports never contain any personally identifiable information.', 'As far as the pay, you’ll receive $20 for signing up and installing their device, the “internet meter”. Then you receive $5 for each month that the meter is plugged in. Every quarter you get a $20 bonus. And they also throw out a few extra bonuses every once in a while, for installing updates and validating your information. I’ve been a member for roughly a year and a half, and have made $365. For doing nothing but keeping a device plugged in.', 'Similar to Digital Reflection, Savvy Connect pays you money when you connect their program to your devices. They collect data as you surf the web, and track trends in online search, shopping, and entertainment. And in return, you earn cash rewards. Savvy Connect is part of the Survey Savvy program.', 'Working a side hustle doesn’t have to take every spare second of your day. Especially if you already have a full-time job. Because your time is just as important as money. And you need to have a healthy balance between work time, fun time, and downtime — or else you may find yourself in an unhappy situation.', 'Also, if you’re not a super-social go-getter, you don’t have to work the hustles that put you out in the spotlight.

Common Pitfalls of Silent Meetings', 'Conclusion']	108	['Meetings suck. It’s a universally accepted truth.', 'I’m here to tell you that they don’t have to. I’m writing with the fervor of a missionary to stop terrible meetings. After discovering Silent Meetings I am converted.', 'This article is meant to be put to use. It’s part workbook and part guide. It’s the 6800+ word expansion of my tweet on this topic but with tons more detail. It’s made to be re-read as you practice Silent Meetings yourself.', '(Only have 1 minute: read this shorter version first)', 'Here’s the outline: after a broad introduction we’ll jump into the problems that loud meetings pose today. We’ll then dive into the Silent Meeting basics: the agenda, Facilitator, creating a Table Read, commenting and discussing. We’ll follow with when and when not to use Silent Meetings. We’ll also deep dive on how to make a good Table Read and we’ll close out with the common pitfalls of Silent Meetings. According to Medium this is about a 20 minute read so let’s get to it.', '[Quick aside: Given the popularity of the post, I turned this also into an eBook to make it easier to read and less ephemeral. If eBooks are more your thing you can find it here on Amazon!]', 'Let me take you into what is a common corporate scene: You’ve been invited to a meeting to discuss something important. You’re sitting in the conference room along with 10 other bright colleagues. You’re optimistic about what you might accomplish together. Your optimism quickly fades. At the front of the room the meeting organizer drones on with poorly-made slides about something that most people in the room already know. Next slide. 20 minutes into the meeting, most are tuned out. The presenter continues with their slides disregarding that half the room is checked out. Next slide. It’s now minute 55 of the 60 minute meeting, you finally have time to ask the two questions you came here initially to discuss. Before you do, however, someone else raises their hand and asks a different question. This takes up the remaining time in the meeting. The question was only half-answered but it’s the end of the allotted time so that’s the end. You walk out hating meetings just a little bit more than before.', 'Here’s where typical meetings fail: Almost none of the attendees’ expertise was used in any way. 60 minutes wasted with almost no exchange of ideas. It’s no wonder meetings get such a bad reputation…', 'Enter Silent Meetings.', '“Silent Meetings” are meetings where most of the time is spent thinking and discussing the topics at hand. Functionally, they are based around a “Table Read” that everyone at the meeting reads silently, comments in and then discusses. An assigned facilitator leads the comment synthesis and discussion to ensure the meeting is valuable. (If you’re itching to learn more about the specifics, jump to Section 3.)', 'Is it 100% silent? Not really. Sometimes it can be 95% silent. Sometimes less. A good rule of thumb is that a meeting is “silent” when more than 50% of the time is spent silently and the time that is not silent is spent on topics that can’t be resolved through comments in a doc (e.g. coordination problems, difficult conversations).', 'The main reason that Silent Meetings are valuable is they focus the attendees around a piece of shared context (the Table Read). This document centers the discussion and cuts off most of the channels that lead typical loud meetings astray.', 'Silent Meetings also enable entirely new ways of working. For example, in a typical meeting setting you don’t really have many-to-many interactions: there is the presenter and then the audience. The relationship is mostly static: one speaks, others listen. In Silent Meetings there is the creator of the original Table Read and the audience that then become creators themselves through their comments. This dynamic enables in-meeting creation instead of just information dissemination. Meetings can become a forum through which work happens instead of corporate, coordination overhead.', 'But do Silent Meetings work? From personal experience I can say, they absolutely do. About a year ago I learned how to use Silent Meetings at Twitter and it has been a liberation: Questions are asked by most attendees in the meeting. Discussions get into nuance and details. Meetings end ahead of schedule. There is better remote attendee participation. And (more often than not) we don’t generate begrudging attendance. Not all Silent Meetings are a panacea (it’s still work after all) but meetings suddenly can become a productive forum for creation instead of one-to-many broadcasting reminiscent of bad elementary school days.', 'Silent Meetings first started at Amazon with Jeff Bezos. At some point in Amazon’s history Bezos declared that Powerpoint would not be allowed and “Narratives” (6-page long-form text documents) would be the main communication vehicle. Since nobody had time to read pre-reads, the document would be read silently during the meeting instead. And so Silent Meetings were born.', 'Silent Meetings then spread through the Amazon diaspora including Alyssa Henry, a former VP at Amazon Web Services who’d worked at Amazon for 8 years. When Alyssa moved to work at Square in San Francisco she brought Silent Meetings with her. As of writing she is the Head of Seller & Developer Business Units & Infrastructure Engineering at Square where Silent Meetings have become established practice.', 'Jack Dorsey, as CEO of Square and Twitter then spread the fire to Twitter where I work as Product Manager. Over the past few years the techniques have morphed at Twitter. I’ve expanded Silent Meetings for my teams to make it our default approach. We use it for small and large meetings — recurring and special events. The largest forums in which I’ve used Silent Meetings are day-long 70-person planning sessions but I also regularly use them for meetings with 4 to 40 people.', 'To help visualize the difference, here is what a typical loud meeting looks like: By my count there are at least 25 attendees with one speaker in this picture. My guess is this meeting might have been better than average given everyone seems focused. However, the one-to-many nature of this meeting makes it extremely likely that this is a bad use of time for the meeting attendees compared to what this group could have achieved through Silent Meetings.', 'For comparison purposes, here is a Silent Meeting at @TwitterBoulder. There are 60 people in attendance. Everyone is collaboratively working. There are Computers and iPads. There is no presenter. The person in the front of the room is facilitating the discussion. Instead of just listening to a presentation, this meeting is a vehicle of work. Most attendees later said it was a great use of their time.', 'Enough background, let’s dive into why traditional meetings suck.', 'If you’re reading this, you’ve probably been in your fair share of meetings. If you work at a larger corporation, this is probably what you spend most of your day “doing”. Probability indicates that most of these meetings are likely very bad uses of your time.', 'Most of us hate going to meetings. It’s something that unites us.', 'Typical “Loud meetings” are bad for a multitude of reasons:', 'Silent meetings fix all of these issues. There are a few short interventions that constitute a “Silent Meeting” and that end up making all the difference:', 'A meeting with these four components constitutes a Silent Meeting. Let’s dive into each step a bit more.', 'Silent Meetings have four basic steps:', 'A few minutes of preparation goes a long way towards making a meeting more successful. This is a universal truth beyond Silent Meetings. A rule of thumb is that the meeting organizer should spend at least as much time organizing the meeting as the meeting itself will last. I find this rule a bit aspirational for the realities of modern corporate workplaces but the general point stands — if you’re calling a meeting to take up everyone’s time, treat that time with respect and make it count.', 'Before your meeting create a basic agenda that includes:', 'With this high-level plan in hand, we then move onto the “Table Read”, the Silent Meeting entree.', 'You might have heard about “pre-reads”, the unicorn doc that everyone aspires to send before a meeting. It’s common to hear, “This meeting should have a pre-read we all can read before we meet.” In this mythical land, someone sends out a comprehensive document for meeting attendees a day or two in advance, everyone reads it thoroughly and shows up prepared for discussion like a university seminar. What ends up happening in reality is that nobody has time.', 'This is why Silent Meetings don’t rely on pre-reading anything. Since the main document is read at the table during the meeting we call them “Table Reads”. As Jeff Bezos states:', '“And so, you’ve got to actually carve out the time for the memo [Table Read] to get read — and that’s what the first half hour of the meeting is for. And then everyone has actually read the memo, they’re not just pretending to have read the memo.”', 'The change from pre-read to Table Read creates common knowledge through a shared artifact for discussion. Everyone at the Silent Meeting has all of the context required. All facts needed are in the doc so everyone is on level footing. This helps foster a productive conversation.', 'Once you have the Table Read, and you’ve convened the meeting, everyone reads and comments in the doc. This is the bulk of the Silent Meeting.', 'To kick off the meeting, the Facilitator or meeting organizer should have everyone follow the process outlined in the Agenda. For the Silent Reading portion the main steps are:', 'While this process might seem odd at first, it eventually becomes habitual and makes it very difficult to go back to normal, loud meetings.', 'This portion of Silent Meetings often results in a quiet din of clacking keyboards. For meetings with remote participants, it’s nice to mute mics during this time.', 'While reading and commenting, it’s important to note that comments should be left unresolved in the doc: Do not delete or resolve others’ comments during this time. Attendees often benefit from seeing the comments left by others and resolving too early shortcuts this process. After the meeting the Facilitator or Table Read owner can read and resolve comments as needed.', 'While attendees are reading the Table Read, the Facilitator is at work combing through the Table Read comments and making sure the right people are tagged throughout. For example, supposed that there is a question about a statistic mentioned in the document. The Facilitator will find the comment and tag whoever is best equipped to answer the question (e.g., in Google Docs terminology “+PersonToAnswerQuestion”).', 'Scanning the comments also gives the Facilitator a sense for what the main questions are from the attendees and what are the most important topics for discussion. Once the reading and commenting period is over the Facilitator can then focus everyone on these topics.', 'For example, if the Facilitator sees two key themes, they can start the discussion period by saying “I see two main themes in the comments. I also see a number of comments with questions that we can discuss outside of the meeting including Theme X that will require a completely separate meeting. For today’s discussion, the main themes that we should discuss are Theme 1 and Theme 2. For Theme 1, let’s look at Attendee 1’s comment…”', 'While occasionally discussion questions are listed in the Table Read, this Facilitator-led method allows the meeting to focus on areas with the highest need for the attendees’ input. This is where a Facilitator can shine and turn an OK Silent Meeting into an excellent one.', 'One final note: Facilitators also own the clock. If you’re approaching the end of the meeting, the Facilitator should try to “land the plane” and identify clear next steps as needed leaving enough time to do so.', 'Silent Meetings are powerful. When they’re well done they can transform a company culture and turn meetings into productive encounters to actually produce value. That said, there are some times where they’re not appropriate.', 'The rule of thumb for when Silent Meetings are great is for any complicated decision that requires deep thought. For example, let’s suppose you are working through a strategic decision like which country your company should go into next. It’s a large meeting with 20–30 attendees representing different functions. In a typical meeting, you’re very likely to end up with many side conversation about tax considerations or other detailed topics. With Silent Meetings, all of these conversations can happen in comments so they don’t distract everyone else. The Table Read provides nuance for the complicated topic and space for attendees to reflect. Meanwhile the discussion can focus on the most important topics that need to be hashed out by the group.', 'This holds true for small and large groups.', 'I’ve found success using Silent Meetings for giant meetings with 40, 60 or more attendees. The Table Read becomes a masterwork of comments which can at times become overwhelming but the amount of thought and connections you can make in a short amount of time is worth it.', 'For meetings with 6–10 people, Silent Meetings work very well. It’s a small group so you don’t have too many comments but it allows deep focus on select topics that then enable deep discussion.', 'This is also true for even smaller meetings. Even one-on-one docs with recurring agendas benefit from silent reading since the attendees can then get through the logistical items quickly and spend most time on the important topics that need verbal discussion. Since most people read faster than they talk, this makes what would normally be a quick 30 minute meeting much more productive than a loud meeting with no clear agenda.', 'There are a few good reasons not to use Silent Meetings.', 'The first is if the purpose of the meeting is to develop group rapport or to discuss difficult, emotional topics. You don’t need a Table Read for this. You also probably don’t want a typical meeting for this either — you just need to sit down and get to know people on a human level and have a real conversation.', 'The second reason not to use Silent Meetings is when the meeting is meant to inspire. I call this the TED Heuristic: Would a TED Talk be appropriate in this situation? If yes, don’t do a Silent Meeting. Making people dream requires storytelling — storytelling is done best by talking out loud with pauses, non-verbal gestures, proper intonation and more.', 'Examples of where TED-talks are appropriate include large conferences. Say you’re presenting your findings from years of work — you want to show off your work through a tight story arc and you don’t really want audience feedback anyway. In this situation, keep the loud meeting format and spend time refining your presentation and slides.', 'Finally, there are large gatherings where the purpose of meeting is broader and more purposeful than just discussing specific topics. For example, large conferences, company all-hands events, social offsites, and ceremonies of all kinds. The objective is to commemorate and connect human-to-human. Silent Meetings are mostly not applicable here.', 'The one area other area where Silent Meetings only half-work are Brainstorming sessions. The best form of brainstorming is when people think independently and then get back together to refine jointly. In other words, they look a lot like Silent Meetings! The main difference is that the overall percent of time spent in silence during a brainstorming session can skew much more heavily to talking vs. reading and often involves a lot more creation. (There is a full art to doing a brainstorming sessions well and that’s for another piece.)', 'While I believe Silent Meetings are a fantastic format and solve a lot of problems with meetings, at the end of the day they don’t solve broken processes nor broken culture. Here is a short list of what they can’t solve:', 'Do you even need this meeting? There are many, many cases where you actually don’t need the meeting in the first place. Can the topic be resolved asynchronously? Then don’t call the meeting. The only exception to this is when the meeting also has a social element that is valuable in and of itself (i.e., the meeting is more of a “home room”). An example of this is a team “daily stand-up” where everyone checks in on what they are doing. There is value to having these meetings synchronously but using elements from Silent Meetings can make them more efficient.', 'Do you need all these people? One large downside of meetings is they take a lot of time. A 1 hour meeting with 20 people is 20 hours of time. Try to keep meetings as small as you can. If you can’t keep them small, try to keep them short. If you can’t do either, spend the effort upfront to make them productive.', 'Is there a clear decision-making process? Picture this: the meeting is coming to a close. A clear decision with pros and cons is on the table. It’s unclear who makes the decision. Everyone looks around confused and the meeting ends ambiguously. I wish I could say that Silent Meetings solve this but alas, they do not. Silent Meetings make it clearer that there is a lack of a clear decision-making process but they won’t solve it for you.', 'Now that I’ve proselytized about how great Silent Meetings are, let’s talk about the core artifact: a good Table Read.', 'The Table Read is the main entree of the Silent Meeting. This is the document that everyone will read and comment in. It has the main discussion points and the context meeting attendees need to participate. So, what makes a good Table Read?', 'Let’s start with the format. A good “Table Read” is a vertical document. By this I mean you scroll up and down, not sideways. This means no PowerPoint, keynote or other form of presentation. Presentations have a role (see prior chapter) but in most meetings they detract from serious discussion. Jeff Bezos articulates why in this email he sent Amazon in 2004:', '“Well structured, narrative text is what we’re after rather than just text. If someone builds a list of bullet points in Word, that would be just as bad as powerpoint.', 'The reason writing a good 4 page memo is harder than “writing” a 20 page powerpoint is because the narrative structure of a good memo forces better thought and better understanding of what’s more important than what, and how things are related.', 'Powerpoint-style presentations somehow give permission to gloss over ideas, flatten out any sense of relative importance, and ignore the interconnectedness of ideas.”', 'To top this all off powerpoint also detracts from meetings because the amount of time people spend formatting presentations is often greater than the thought they spend on the content. The formatting then leads to compromises: if the content doesn’t fit on a slide it’s often discarded. This is where nuance goes to die.', 'The main tool you want to use instead of slides is some form of vertical, ideally also collaborative, document — I recommend Google Docs.', '(Sidenote: I know Microsoft has some nice options nowadays but I’m entrenched in the Google Suite. For designers I think Figma can serve similar purposes.)', 'The Table Read is a flexible document. You can adjust it to fit your needs.', 'Below is an example outline of a Table Read based loosely on Amazon’s Narrative (6-page memo) structure. Note that this is just an example — you can modify the structure of the Table Read to the type of meeting you have. For example, if you often review Pricing decisions or User Research results, you can make Table Reads that are appropriate to those topics.', 'A common Strategic Narrative Table Read often involves mixing and matching the pieces below:', 'I’ve also included an example Table Read in this Google Doc if you want to copy it as a template. This is just an example format and you should create new templates for your particular needs.', 'One final note: if the idea or meeting you are having is brand new and you don’t know what to put in a Table Read, use the beginning of the meeting as the forum for the creation of the document. For instance, the Facilitator can set out the main headers based on the attendees in the meeting (e.g., “Finance” “Accounting” “Tax”) and then fill the doc in throughout the meeting. Afterwards, you now have a new template for future Silent Meetings with this group or on this topic.', 'What is the desired outcome from the Table Read? Let’s go back to the source at Amazon. Here is Jeff Bezos’ in Amazon’s 2017 Shareholder letter talking about Amazon’s“Six-Page Narratives”:', 'We don’t do PowerPoint (or any other slide-oriented) presentations at Amazon. Instead, we write narratively structured six-page memos. We silently read one at the beginning of each meeting in a kind of “study hall.” Not surprisingly, the quality of these memos varies widely. Some have the clarity of angels singing. They are brilliant and thoughtful and set up the meeting for high-quality discussion. Sometimes they come in at the other end of the spectrum.', '[…] The difference between a great memo and an average one is much squishier. It would be extremely hard to write down the detailed requirements that make up a great memo. Nevertheless, I find that much of the time, readers react to great memos very similarly. They know it when they see it. The standard is there, and it is real, even if it’s not easily describable.', 'Here’s what we’ve figured out. Often, when a memo isn’t great, it’s not the writer’s inability to recognize the high standard, but instead a wrong expectation on scope: they mistakenly believe a high-standards, six-page memo can be written in one or two days or even a few hours, when really it might take a week or more! […] The great memos are written and re-written, shared with colleagues who are asked to improve the work, set aside for a couple of days, and then edited again with a fresh mind. They simply can’t be done in a day or two. The key point here is that you can improve results through the simple act of teaching scope — that a great memo probably should take a week or more.” [Emphasis added]', 'What does it look like to make a good Table Read? How does one do this practically?', 'The key is iteration.', 'The Table Read author needs to get many rounds of feedback and then incorporate them into the doc. Most of this can mostly happen asynchronously or in small, focused meetings. As the author gathers feedback, the challenge then is how to incorporate it all. This is the Art of Commenting & FAQs.', 'As you prepare your Table Read you will very likely get feedback from someone either directly in the doc or indirectly through other conversations. Every question you get is a gift: they are the clues that will guide you to the the hot-button issues of the doc, they tell you what parts are not clear and they show the way to greatness.', 'The main strategy for handling questions and comments is to either incorporate them into the main document or add them to the FAQs.', 'While this sounds straightforward, there is an art to handling comments, especially during a meeting when they can accumulate quite quickly. The main way of triaging comments is by type.', 'Some comments are about specifics: “Do you have the link to this data? What does this acronym mean? Who can I talk to to learn more about this sentence?” These comments can be answered directly and eventually incorporated into the main document by adding links or footnotes.', 'Another type of comment is more strategic: “Why do you believe that X is the case? I disagree with your interpretation of this data. This is a bad idea.” These comments are flagging hot-button topics. They are your guide-posts for the important discussions you should have in the non-silent part of the Silent Meeting. Once the questions are settled, they should be documented into the main doc (e.g., “here is why we think this is a good idea after further discussion”) or added directly to the FAQs (e.g., “Why do we believe that X is the case? {here is the summary of our discussion}).', 'A final type of comment is more tangential: “How does this proposal relate to Y? What about the costs of Z?” These questions, while related to the main Table Read, are not important enough to the main narrative to be included in the document. However, they are important to add to the FAQs to track over time. If they are irrelevant though, they can be removed outright.', 'Frequent comment management makes Table Reads stronger.', 'Table Reads often have the following rules of thumb:', 'They are not too long: Table Reads should be read in ⅓–½ of the allotted meeting time. Adjust this towards the lower range if you anticipate lots of comments in the meeting. For example, it should take about 10 minutes to read a Table Read for a 30 minute meeting. If there are lots of comments it’s likely this Table Read could easily occupy 20 minutes. If it’s a controversial topic or if it’s an area that is new to the commenters, budget even more time.', '6-pages is enough for a complex topic: The Amazon rule of thumb for a Table Read is that it should be less than 6 pages of written text (excluding the Appendix). Assuming the Table Read is for a strategic topic with a lot of discussion, 6-pages is appropriate for a 1-hour meeting with about 15 minutes of reading, 10–15 minutes of commenting and 30 minutes of discussion.', 'Include any information needed for the attendees in the Table Read itself: Avoid using the Appendix, or clicking out to other docs as much as possible to avoid attendee attention leakage. Spell out acronyms. Use links for external sources of information but don’t expect audience members to click through. Use footnotes where nuanced points need to be made that are only relevant for a subset of readers.', 'If a meeting is very long consider breaking the Table Read into sections: Optimal reading size per section should be less than 30 minutes. If it’s longer than this attendees will lose interest. For example, say you have two hours worth of discussion. It’s then worth splitting the Table Read into halves. For each half you can read, comment, discuss, take a break and then repeat the process. You can organize full day sessions this way by stringing together reading periods with a series of breaks.', 'You have a Table Read. Everyone’s in the room. You start the meeting. Magic?', 'Almost… There are a few common pitfalls that befall people new to Silent Meetings — especially if they benefited from loud meeting structures. Here are some common scenarios:', 'No Facilitator: The Silent Meeting starts and nobody is implicitly nor explicitly the Facilitator. While everyone starts reading, chaos lies in wait. Since nobody is assigned to facilitate the meeting and guide discussion, as soon as a difficult conversation arises the conversation is almost certainly going to rabbit-hole. Most often, nobody will reclaim the reins of the meeting to ensure focused group discussion. The meeting will then revert to being loud and unproductive.', 'Bad facilitation: Similarly, you could have a Facilitator in the meeting that is ineffective; the Facilitator could either be oblivious to group dynamics or not have sufficient gravitas to steer the group discussion. Bad Facilitators often feel bad about interjecting — they can let very loud people run off with the meeting. Bad Facilitators can also not keep the meeting strictly on track — they don’t monitor meeting timing, they don’t drive to conclusions and they leave questions open ended without clear next steps.', 'Verbose Table Reads: Another common pitfall is where all the elements of the Silent Meeting are in place but the Table Read is too long. The tell-tale sign of this is when the Facilitator calls the silent portion to a close and the audience is still commenting in the doc. This is a subtle flaw but a real one. Since the group was not able to fully comment, the result is that a large number of burning questions haven’t been recorded in the doc. These questions are now likely to come up in the group discussion. In a proper Silent Meeting most questions get asked and answered in the Table Read ensuring the discussion focuses on the most important topics. Without this, the full power of the Table Read is missed and the meeting is likely to revert to being loud with tangential questions.', 'Comment overload: Suppose you’re in a 30 minute Silent Meeting. Comments are flowing — small questions, large existential questions. Everyone needs more time to think and reflect. The Facilitator calls an end to the silence at the 25 minute mark but there are dozens of meaty questions to discuss. The common mistake in this scenario is that the Facilitator tries to cram all the answers into the remainder of the meeting when there is no way to effectively have these important discussions. This is likely a sign that the meeting was premature and the Table Read could have benefited from a lot more iteration. It could also be a sign that this topic merits a lot more discussion than the time allotted.', 'Bad post-meeting comment management: It was a great meeting. Everyone left good comments and the Facilitator led a good discussion on the most important topics. However, there were a number of outstanding small and large questions in the Table Read that required follow-up. And yet they remained untouched… forever. The Table Read became a dead-doc instead of a vehicle of work. The solution here is to ensure that someone is on the hook for going through and resolving comments appropriately. (See “The Art of Comments & FAQs in Chapter 5 above)', 'Bad Table Reads: You budgeted time. Everyone is in attendance. You start reading and realize the doc has not been edited — it’s sprawling and not ready for group consumption. The doc amasses tons of comments and some of them are very basic (e.g., “How does this recommendation tie to the recommendation below? This is illogical.”). This is a clear sign that the meeting was premature and the Table Read needed more work. The doc could have been shared asynchronously (e.g., email) and improved upon outside of a meeting before convening everyone to discuss.', 'Unexplained acronyms & lack of context: Most companies have new people joining teams frequently. A polite Table Read spells out acronyms and includes basic context on key topics. Absent this, many comments are just clarifying basic points in the document instead of the more strategic questions.', 'Right discussion, wrong forum: Often Table Reads will lead to great questions and deep discussions. Occasionally the questions might be outside of the purview and purpose of that meeting. For example, suppose you are discussing the best pricing scheme for a new product but then there is a question about the company’s overall strategy or mission. This might be a great question but it’s most likely the wrong forum to discuss. A good Facilitator will identify this and table these questions for separate discussion outside of the meeting.', 'I believe Silent Meetings are just in their infancy. They expand our conception for how group work happens and they have the potential to change much more of corporate and non-corporate world. Silent Conferences, Silent Board Meetings, Silent All-Hands, Silent Government meetings, Silent Town Halls… I’m want to see their evolution and expansion globally. Silent Meetings fundamentally change the nature of work.', 'This manifesto is v1. I intend to keep updating it in future versions as Silent Meetings continue to develop.', 'If you use Silent Meetings and have suggestions for how to improve them, please tweet suggestions to @SilentMeeting on Twitter. I will keep track of the suggestions and then incorporate into future versions of this doc.', 'Use Silent Meetings. Make everyone’s day better. Make meetings suck a little less.', 'If you’ve made it this far, thank you! I also tweet about more varied topics @gasca. For more, here’s a list of other work I’ve written.', 'PS — for Designers & Universities, a few variations since publishing this post:']

At this moment, your brain is simultaneously maintaining your breathing and heart rate, while turning these black squiggles on a screen into coherent words and thoughts.', 'The brain is a workhorse and a hungry one at that. While accounting for approximately 2% of the average adult’s weight, it accounts for 20% of its energy consumption, more than any other organ.', 'Go ahead and give your brain a mental compliment and then think about how meta that was.', 'Fascinated yet? You’re not alone. Neuroscience research is booming. Growing interest and funding for neuroscience research has given rise to a burgeoning field of interdisciplinary neuroscience that ranges from clinical studies in neurodegenerative and behavioral disorders to basic science studies characterizing brain structure and function at the molecular level– and all this is for good reason.', 'In 2014, just nine common neurological diseases (Alzheimer’s and other dementias, chronic lower back pain, stroke, TBI, migraines, epilepsy, MS, TSCI, and Parkinson’s) were estimated to cost the American people almost 800 billion dollars, a number that has only increased over time. And despite the abundance of sensationalist reporting that might suggest otherwise, there is currently no panacea for a sick brain.', 'Yet the research does suggest that quality sleep, among other factors, generally improves brain health and we’re only just starting to understand why.', 'Sleep is quite mysterious. Even today, we aren’t completely sure about the true evolutionary function of sleep. Yet surely, it must be important as most mammals die after more than a week of complete sleep-deprivation. So what is really going on behind the scenes?', 'With the exception of a few brief exciting and oftentimes bizarre dreams in REM sleep, our experience of sleep seems rather boring. While Drake and friends may think they are ‘out like a light’ when they fall asleep, the light is, in fact, still very much on. The “sleeping” brain is still firing, sending electrochemical signals and using lots of energy, particularly during REM sleep.', 'Previously, sleep research relied heavily on measuring electrical activity on the surface of the brain using EEG or measuring blood flow using fMRI. These tools are popular because they are non-invasive, but they lack the detail that would come from looking at a brain sample after death.', 'The advances in newer methods such as two-photon microscopy allow highly-penetrant, in-vivo imaging in a precise focal plane. In other words, you can look through the skull to observe microscopic brain structures in alive, sleeping subjects in real-time. How neat is that?', 'These methods have allowed sleep researchers to make some truly breathtaking discoveries, but before you get woke to some to these rousing findings, let’s take time to review some relevant Neurophysiology 101.', 'In an elegantly-designed experiment published in 2012, scientists injected a fluorescent tracer into the CSF of mice to follow its flow. Interestingly, the tracer appeared to be following the network of arteries carrying fresh blood to the brain.', 'However, the tracer wasn’t in the arteries, just around them. What they eventually found was that the CSF was flowing in the space between the outer walls of the arteries and the surrounding glial cells. If you can imagine putting a smaller pipe into a larger pipe, allowing two distinct fluids to flow in parallel along the same network, you’ve begun to understand periarterial flow.', 'In addition to the pressure gradient that keeps the fluid moving, the pulses of blood in your arteries also help push the CSF along.', 'This CSF moves into the water surrounding cells, or interstitial fluid, and washes over them, delivering nutrients and clearing away harmful cellular waste products. It then travels through perivenous spaces, which surround veins, to be dumped into lymphatic vessels where the waste is filtered out.', 'This, in short, is the glymphatic (glial lymphatic) system and it acts as the brain’s sewer system. Surprisingly, it was discovered just seven years ago by Dr. Maiken Nedergaard’s group at the University of Rochester Medical Center.', 'Perhaps the most interesting quirk about the glymphatic system is that it is only active during sleep. The perivascular tunnels are tightened during wakefulness, limiting CSF flow; this change is likely mediated by norepinephrine, a neuromodulator that is abundant only in wakefulness.', 'Several studies have shown that as you sleep, the glymphatic system is clearing your brain of neurotoxic substances that have accumulated throughout the day, including amyloid-beta, the protein that forms the characteristic plaques in Alzheimer’s. In a vicious cycle, impaired glymphatic function increases the accumulation of amyloid-beta, which in turn limits CSF influx through the glymphatic system.', 'And indeed glymphatic efficiency is impaired in the brains of current models of Alzheimer’s disease and generalized aging, although the possibility of a causal relationship presents a less-clear, chicken-or-egg-first type of question.', 'Fortunately, more people are coming around to the idea that sleep is not a luxury. There is strong evidence for how sleep affects learning, obesity, hypertension, insulin sensitivity, and you don’t need a peer-reviewed article to tell you that sleep affects your mood.', 'For many young people, not getting enough sleep is no longer a humblebrag for an industrious work ethic, but rather a mark of neglect for one’s well-being. Yet, while surveys suggest that Americans are getting slightly more weekday sleep than in previous years, only 10% of respondents said they prioritize sleep over fitness, work, or their hobbies.', 'Good hygiene comes in many different forms.

That if we act in a toxic way, we draw more toxicity to us.', 'How valid is that idea?', 'Yes, if you are behaving in a very toxic manner, you might be sending out a vibe that draws in those on the same wavelength. But that’s not always true.', 'We all inhabit different spaces: a home, a workplace, a family, a friendship circle… Some of these areas (like our friendships or work) are more open to our choices. Others, though, are not (like our families).', 'Of course, there are always choices. But it’s not always as simple as “stop being toxic”. The idea that we are responsible for the actions of others isn’t strictly fair.', 'However, I think it is possible to set a tone in a relationship that suggests you operate a certain way — and others may respond in kind. You might not be a “toxic person” in general. You might just be doing something toxic, without realising it.', 'You might be someone who wants to fix others, please others, a perfectionist, have low self esteem, issues with jealousy… And not everything comes from a toxic place. There can be so many reasons for attracting the wrong people.', 'But if it is a toxic habit that you’ve inadvertently picked up, for any reasons, there are ways to undo these. After all, if you know you’re doing what you can, you’ve got a much better shot at recognising bad behaviour in others, too.', 'Are you loyal? Do you think white lies are ok? Does reliability matter to you? Would you be hurt if someone spoke ill of you behind your back?', 'A lot of toxic things we might be doing come from the fact that we’re just not thinking about how they would affect us, were roles reversed. We forget what it is that’s important to us, or sensitive to us.', 'For instance, I have a real thing about people cancelling on something I’ve organised at the very last minute. I have a bit of a phobia, let’s say, that despite organising an event, nobody will show up. As a result, I do my utmost never to cancel last minute. Obviously, emergencies come up. But I do more these days to just say ‘no’ when the invite comes in, rather than dithering back and forth on whether or not I really want to go. This is, in part, because I know how hurtful it might be if someone got lots of last minute drop outs.', 'I really value being reliable in general, and I look out for this in other people. I want people who will show up for me. So if I start saying no to all attempts to reach out to me, I know I won’t be living my values out. I have to practice what I preach. I have to be reliable in order to know what reliability looks like.', 'I’ve written more about how you can figure out your values and live by them here:', 'It’s a process, for sure, and we’re all learning. But starting with your values is a good first bet to ensuring you aren’t inadvertently doing the exact things you fear.', 'I can’t stress active listening enough. If you are someone who struggles to remember what people have said to you, it can be hard to notice this. I’ve known people who asked again and again the exact same questions of me, having forgotten (or perhaps not heard) my answer.

I’ve just been really all over the place with things lately. I’ll do better next time.”', 'Don’t dwell on the “excuse” though. We all have shit going on. If you’re doing everything to come up with an excuse that is iron-clad and perhaps which even makes the other person feel bad for pointing this out, that is getting into toxic behaviour.

It talks through many potential reasons for feeling disinterest in others — social awkwardness, an inability to push a conversation beyond surface small talk, etc. To quote:', 'Some people feel disinterested in others because they don’t give them a chance. They’ve already made up their mind that everyone is boring and don’t do anything to prove themselves wrong. They’ll meet someone new and, consciously or not, won’t even try to take the conversation in an interesting direction. Instead they’ll put up with a few minutes of uninspired small talk, then walk away thinking, “See? Another person I couldn’t get interested in.”', 'This is a pretty clear self-fulfilling cycle.

Feedback is important, and while it can be easy to ignore bad feedback in some scenarios, it’s worth questioning repeated concerns.', 'For instance, I’ve been told more than a few times that I am a fairly direct person. Sometimes the word used has been ‘blunt’ or ‘abrupt’. I acknowledge that is very true! And I’m probably not going to eliminate this quality altogether, but I know now better when to use it, because I’m aware of it. Sometimes this can be useful, in certain scenarios (cutting through complaints to focus on solutions, for instance). Other times it may be a hinderance (like if someone is talking through a complex problem and wants the space to really get into details).', 'Awareness has helped make choices about when to use aspects of my character more openly, and when not to. I don’t see this as changing who I am, but rather using what I’ve got in a more thoughtful way.', 'Part of asking for help, of course, can be giving help too. But be aware of constructive versus destructive feedback. I’ll write more on this soon, but suffice to say that feedback is hard to give and hard to get sometimes — be aware of looking for constructive feedback, that actually gives you a clue about specific concerns that are actionable, rather than destructive feedback which tries to undermine who you are as a whole person.', 'Ultimately, nobody arrives fully formed into life. We’re all on a journey here. Asking for the help you need to arrive at better relationships with others is never a weakness.', 'Making it to the end of this article tells me that you care about who you are, your place in the world — how you operate in it.', 'Here’s a little more reading on the subject, if of interest:', 'Christina Carè is an Australian writer and podcaster based in London.

To throw away what you no longer need is neither wasteful nor shameful.”', 'That advice comes from Marie Kondo, the Japanese author and decluttering expert who has become perhaps the biggest contemporary challenge to mass consumption. A big part of her minimalist ethos — her book is titled The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up — is the idea that we’re buying way too much stuff, most of which does nothing to enhance our lives.', 'For the most part, Kondo focuses on mindless material things — the plastic crap, cheap clothing and general tchotchkes that clutter up our homes. She asks people to hold individual items in their hands to see whether they “spark joy.” If they don’t, she recommends that they get rid of them immediately.', 'But we can also use Kondo’s example to explore the idea of clutter much more broadly.', 'Think of it this way:', 'Before you declutter your house, shouldn’t you consider decluttering your mind?', 'The average American spends over 10.5 hours of their day consuming media, whether that’s watching TV, surfing online, using an app or listening to a podcast. What kinds of things do you take in on a daily basis — including Netflix shows, YouTube videos, the seemingly endless Internet hot takes and options on Tinder — and what impact do they have on not just your joy but your creativity?', 'When it comes to information, we’re often encouraged to think that the more, the better. We’re in an information economy, after all, so shouldn’t we tune in as much as possible?', 'But consider this: Are you confusing knowledge attainment with mindless consumption?', 'Srinivas Rao, author of An Audience of One: Reclaiming Creativity for Its Own Sake, says that managing our inflow — what and how much we consume — is crucial to creative output. “Excessive consumption and inflow inhibit creativity, negatively impacts our ability to do deep work and reduces our cumulative output,” writes Rao.', 'As CEO of JotForm, a business with over 140 employees and 4.9 millions of users, I know about the importance of creative output and I refuse to simply rely on the spark of inspiration to arrive in the midst of daily noise.', 'I’ve had to come up with effective methods for cultivating creativity. I’m committed to “morning pages,” a key way I’ve learned to tune out many of life’s overwhelming distractions so I can channel my own voice and vision.', 'Every morning, I mute my phone and create an empty space that I can fill with my own ideas.', 'As I’ve noted before, introducing restrictions — like powering down your phone — might be the true secret to unleashing creativity, even if that seems counterintuitive.', 'We live in an age of overstimulation, where we take our phones to the bathroom and use WiFi even on airplanes. We so rarely sit with our own thoughts because we spend so much time consuming the thoughts of others.', 'But according to boredom researcher (yes, that’s a thing) Dr. Sandi Mann, slowing down and letting your mind wander enables you to tap into both your conscious and subconscious mind — and that’s where you start to access the connections that drive creativity.', 'Heather Lench, a psychologist at Texas A&M University, has described being bored as “a seeking state” — and what is the process of creating if not actively seeking out new concepts, improvements and ways to engage with the world?', 'Manoush Zomorodi’s book Bored and Brilliant: How Spacing Out Can Unlock Your Most Productive and Creative Self has inspired Bored and Brilliant challenges, where participants are encouraged to watch but not photograph their world, to write down small observations about their environment, and to block out time when they won’t be available online — all with the aim of boosting their individual creative process.', 'According to research reported by Harvard Business Review, letting your mind wander and quieting the mind can lead to breakthrough insights. But to do that, you have to be willing to slow down and shut out competing influences.', 'That isn’t easy to do, especially at a time when more and more of our interaction is virtual, and more and more of our consumption is passive rather than participatory.', 'Eric Weiner, author of The Geography of Genius, has explored the influence of social interaction in a “third place,” like the historic coffee houses of Vienna, where budding geniuses were spurred on by an exchange of ideas.', '“People from all different walks of life go there and conversation is unstructured and flowing,” says Weiner.', 'Note the difference: In this case, you’re not simply consuming the ideas of others but actively contributing your own. Dialogue can spark inspiration or help make a good idea even better.', 'And there’s another way to think about limiting consumption to boost creation: Some experts suggest that focusing your energies is the key.', 'Instead of trying to come up with as many ideas as possible — those familiar “blue sky” meetings where whiteboards fill up with any and all suggestions — narrow the scope. Scott Anthony, the managing partner of Innosight and author of The First Mile, calls such constraints “the greatest enablers of creativity.”', 'How does that apply to consumption? Think about the wide range of ideas you consume every day; what if you narrowed the scope to things that are directly related to problems you’re actively trying to solve?', 'One of the ways I’ve learned to limit empty consumption is by establishing robust systems and automation — which takes more time on the front end but can save you lots of time down the road.', 'Cutting back busywork — everything from email responses to shopping for groceries in person — can leave you with additional time to do the important stuff, including giving your mind time to rest and renew. One of Rao’s top tips includes creating separate email accounts for essential versus non-essential messages, separating feedback from colleagues from notifications about hotel discounts.', 'Constant consumption can be related to FOMO — or, fear of missing out.', 'We worry that if we aren’t informed about the latest research or haven’t read the latest viral articles, then we’re going to be left behind.', 'But while we might assume maximal consumption helps us stay at the top of our game, that kind of thinking can actually be counterproductive to the kind of productivity and creativity we’re actively trying to cultivate.', 'As we’ve become accustomed to refreshing our email every 30 seconds, we’ve compromised our creative potential.', 'So next time you get stuck, try scheduling a break and switching course, whether it’s taking a walk, having a shower or lying down for a 20-minute nap. You’ll be surprised how quickly your brain gets to work when you give it the space to explore.', 'Crucially, I’ve learned that creativity isn’t some sort of divine gift. Like anything else, it’s a muscle you have to exercise. And when you do that, you’ll see results.', 'And in a world where everyone’s always trying to do more, sometimes we can benefit from doing less — or, at least, from being more selective, more disciplined and more willing to spend time with our own thoughts instead of constantly chasing someone else’s influence.']

Not every business can be self-funded, and sometimes, outside investment is exactly the right choice. We all need to chart our own paths. But bootstrappers remind us to question the prevailing startup narratives and ask, “Do we really need to raise VC money?”', 'It’s well worth taking a breath, setting the pitch deck aside for a moment, and considering an alternative route.', 'Starting a business isn’t easy. There are risks, challenges, and complications, whether you leverage your own cash or you pursue venture capital. Reading headline after headline about record-setting funding rounds, however, can make VC backing look glamorous — and perhaps even necessary.', 'Most of us can name the well-funded success stories: Facebook, Google, WhatsApp, Alibaba, Rent the Runway, Uber, and more. But for every famous brand, there are thousands of VC-funded firms that quietly grew and then fizzled. That’s why it’s good to take a clear-eyed look at the statistics.', 'Research by Harvard lecturer Shikhar Ghosh reveals that about 75% of VC-backed companies in the U.S. fail, meaning they don’t return the investors’ capital. If we define failure as not delivering the projected return on investment, however, then more than 95% of startups fail, says Ghosh.', 'Just like a bicycle, a startup requires some speed to stay upright. But once a founder accepts outside cash, the clock really starts ticking.', 'Here’s another way to think about it. If VC funding is the fabled hare, then bootstrapping is the tortoise. It’s slow and steady, but it keeps on going (and going and going).', 'We know that premature scaling is the number one cause of startup failure. Eager new founders often drain their cash on big offices, the latest technology, splashy PR and marketing campaigns, and hiring full teams — long before they’re ready or even need the support. Sometimes their investors push for these outward signs of accomplishment.', 'Bootstrappers rarely face the same pressures. They don’t have to meet arbitrary timelines or show hockey stick growth charts. Instead, they have the freedom to set their own targets. They make the rules, and, most importantly, they decide what “success” looks like — even if that definition is constantly evolving.', 'Clearly, bootstrapping doesn’t eliminate all problems. To grow a business without external funding, you have to swim, or you’ll sink fast. You have to be creative and strategic, but that can also make you a better entrepreneur. Here are three more advantages of taking the self-funded route.', 'It doesn’t matter if you’re a designer, product engineer, developer, or a UX specialist. As a bootstrapped founder, you’re probably also shipping packages, answering calls, and writing social media posts. That’s how it goes.

Once it’s time to hire someone for that role, you know exactly what to look for and what to avoid.', '*Quick tip: At JotForm, we hire and grow slowly.

It’s bright and it shows the company is Doing. Big. Things. Until a business truly needs that kind of space, however, it’s not a smart expense.', 'It’s easy to get distracted, but bootstrappers can make strategic choices, like using open-source software and upgrading later, if necessary. Or working from home, renting a desk in a co-working space, and doing the PR and accounting until you can afford to get help.', 'In the early stages of a startup, the business is still pliable. You can release a product, gather user feedback, and adapt to real market needs. That’s an advantage.', 'Entrepreneurs often chase perfection, but it’s not only impossible; it can put your company at risk.', 'New founders should release their products as soon as possible. Don’t even try to make it perfect. Hundreds of startups have adapted and pivoted their way to success:', 'When startups work obsessively to create the “ultimate” first release, they can also be tempted to argue with their customers — even when customers share honest feedback about what they want and need. That’s why staying lean and flexible can be a major business advantage.', 'After college, I spent five years working as a programmer for a New York-based media company. I learned so much there: how my mentors accomplished their goals and how to collaborate with team members. I also saw how micromanagement destroys staff motivation.

When there’s no pressure to meet a revenue target (or make any money at all), we’re free to play, explore and learn.

And it sounds so simple; after all, who wouldn’t use the product they built? But a startup has so many moving parts that founders can quickly become detached from their original mission.', 'Once a product or service is shipping, it’s important to stay close to the heart of your offering. Use it, consume it, order it, and dig into the details. Engagement puts you back in the customer’s shoes, so you experience any problems firsthand. It also keeps the team (no matter how small) on its toes.', 'Additionally, If the startup was built to scratch your own itch, there are always more opportunities to extend the solution. Ask yourself:', 'How else could this product serve me, personally?', 'What would make this solution more valuable — both to current and potential customers?', 'Very few problems in life are tackled once and solved forever. Startups aren’t stagnant, either. They need to evolve with needs, culture and markets. When you keep mining the problem (and the solution), it can keep the business fresh and vibrant.', 'Sonny and Cher. Bert and Ernie. Calvin and Hobbes. Thelma and Louise.', 'Pop culture loves a good duo. So does the startup world.', 'Investors like Paul Graham often want to back businesses run by partners with complementary skills. Apple, for example, paired the late, sales-savvy Steve Jobs with Steve Wozniak, who focused on technology.', 'But when co-founders don’t gel, the results can be disastrous. “Startups do to the relationship between the founders what a dog does to a sock,” says Graham. “If it can be pulled apart, it will be.”', 'According to Noam Wasserman, a professor at Harvard Business School, 65% of high-potential startups fail due to conflict among the founders. Wasserman studied 10,000 entrepreneurs for his book, The Founder’s Dilemma, and suggests that multiple founders bring more skills to the table, but they also have more potential for disputes over money, strategy, leadership, credit, and other issues.', 'It makes sense. Multiple founders can get behind the wheel, but they have to agree on the destination, plus everything from who’s in the back seat to the best driving route. Many founders also have a strong desire for freedom, which can quickly feel stifled when someone else weighs in on every detail.', '“Picking a co-founder is your most important decision,” says Naval Ravikan, co-founder of the AngelList platform. “It’s more important than the product, market, and investors.”', 'Ravikan makes a bold statement. Not everyone would agree that the partnership matters more than the product — or the market. But starting a business is a massive commitment. You’re picking someone with whom to share your life’s work. You’ll also share money, space, risk, and a whole lot of time.', 'The right partnership is powerful. Working with the wrong person can feel heavy and frustrating (at the very least) and, in the worst case, it can destroy the business.', 'That’s why a founders’ agreement should be excruciatingly detailed. Hire an experienced lawyer, if you go this route, and plan for everything: equity breakdown, vesting schedules, intellectual property, termination clauses, and more. Ensure that everyone is clear on the terms and feels fully protected, should the partnership go south.', 'If you’re not sure about a potential co-founder, there’s no reason to rush. As I explained in Why you don’t need a co-founder to start your own business , take your time and see how it feels to work on your own.', 'Forget what the VCs say — especially if you’re prepared to bootstrap. As Ravikan says, “if you’re compromising, keep looking. A company’s DNA is set by the founders, and its culture is an extension of the founders’ personalities.”', 'Entrepreneurs who do trust themselves to go solo are often rewarded with the ultimate freedom. Spanx founder Sara Blakely, for example, built a global company without a co-founder or any outside investment. At age 41, she became the youngest self-made female billionaire — and she still owns 100% of the company.', 'Entrepreneurs, of all people, should know that rules are meant to be broken. That’s half the fun. So, partner up or stay solo, but do it on your terms, with your eyes wide open.', 'Most startup experts worship at the altar of rapid expansion. They even have a pattern for it, called “hockey stick growth,” which occurs when revenues start out flat and then quickly shoot up to create that iconic curve.', '“Aiming for hockey-stick growth, while being aware of the predictable stages of growth, is exactly what successful entrepreneurs should do,” writes entrepreneur Bobby Martin, author of The Hockey Stick Principles .', 'Investors dream about rapid growth, too. They want to recover their money fast, so they often pressure companies to expand quickly.', 'A hockey stick looks great on paper, but it typically requires the business to grow revenues first and figure out profits later. That can put the company at risk. Bootstrappers take the opposite approach. They sort out profits first and stay focused on that key goal.', 'Slow growth takes patience and a good dose of bravery. It’s normal to feel some FOMO as you watch other firms double, then triple their staff overnight. But slow growth can provide stability. It also enables founders to sleep well at night, spend time with the people they love, and create products that attract loyal, satisfied customers.', 'Here are four more reasons to take the slow road.', 'Bootstrapping math is pretty simple: spend less than you earn and you can grow at your own pace. It’s simple, but it’s not effortless.', 'When we celebrate companies that raise millions and post huge vanity metrics, like user acquisitions, that math can seem almost too simple.', 'Glorifying hockey stick growth also implies that you can chase flashy numbers now and worry about profits later. In today’s market, it’s not uncommon to hear the question, “how, exactly, do they make money?”', 'But profits provide freedom — even when they’re modest. Make decisions that keep your company in the black, right from day one. After all, a bootstrapped business needs to work, because there are no hefty bank deposits to fall back on.', 'Newly-funded companies often face pressure to fill every seat — immediately. “Hire fast, fire faster” has even become a startup mantra. There’s a sense that Christmas is coming, so Santa better hire as many elves as possible. It doesn’t matter if they’re out of work by February.', 'Building the right team is essential. These are the people who will build and nurture the product. They’ll implement new ideas and interact with customers. As Todoist founder Amir Salihefendic says, “Optimize on output. Don’t optimize on the number of people you hire.”', 'Caring about customers is good for business. That’s not a tagline; it’s an effective way to bootstrap. VC-backed companies often start out with deep knowledge of their audience. Over time, though, it’s easy to confuse what customers want with what investors want.', 'If you believe that growth reigns supreme, then it will quickly become the primary focus.', '“Traction and product development are of equal importance and should each get about half of your attention,” says Gabriel Weinberg, a successful CEO and the author of Traction. “This is what we call the 50 percent rule: spend 50 percent of your time on product and 50 percent on traction.”', 'Very few people are born knowing exactly how to lead — or to design, code, market, sell, and build. Aggressive growth can quickly highlight those knowledge gaps, which are totally okay. Most people launch businesses to create a smart solution, not because they want to run staff meetings.', 'Growingly slowly enables you to learn alongside your team. You can learn how to manage and motivate those people, too. Mistakes can also be smaller when you’re not feeling the heat from investors, or you suddenly see 50 new faces in the office, all eager for direction. Take your time and you can:', 'Customers. As we focus on funding options, it’s easy to leave end users out of the conversation. Even the term “users” dehumanizes the people who will buy what we create. But bootstrapped companies ultimately answer to their customers, not to investors. We have an obligation to listen closely to customer needs , feedback , and ideas — and that’s a good thing.', 'Even criticism is great for business, because it pushes the team to stretch and innovate. Customer-funded growth keep us honest; they ensure we don’t stray off track. That’s a powerful advantage.', 'Never assume you know what customers want; you have to look at the data. We’re lucky to live in an era where we can create a hypothesis and then test it without overt bias. Making a product change? Release it to a small group and establish a clear way to measure user reactions. Apply what you learn and test again.', 'Testing doesn’t mean you’re beholden to customer whims, either. You create the “what,” and customers help to show you “how.” For example, Airbnb’s mission is to create “a world where people can belong through healthy travel that is local, authentic, diverse, inclusive and sustainable.” How, exactly they do that is still up to the smart people running the company.', 'According to surveys conducted for American Express:', 'The numbers are clear: customer service matters deeply. Support teams do much more than resolve tickets and answer tedious questions; they have a massive effect on company growth.', 'Sexy customer acquisition stats usually get the spotlight, but it’s better to spend time, energy, and money on satisfying existing customers than winning over new ones. In fact, data shows that it’s anywhere from 5 to 25 times more expensive to acquire a new customer than to keep a current one.', 'Extraordinary customer support doesn’t even require extraordinary efforts; you just need to consistently exceed expectations:', 'Bootstrapping is not a great way to get PR. And most self-funded entrepreneurs are too busy refining their product to worry about landing on magazine covers.', 'A little publicity certainly never hurts but what does the attention really do — especially if it’s about the business, not the product itself? Most customers don’t read industry or tech publications anyway. Once the attention fades, you’re still left with the same mission and the same challenges.', 'Highly-publicized funding rounds can also put you under a microscope. For example, Nasty Gal founder Sophia Amoruso made headlines in 2016 when her fashion brand filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, after raising $65 million over 10 years.', 'Now that she’s launched a new venture, called Girlboss, both critics and fans are tracking her every move. Many other founders have been in Amoruso’s shoes, too. Well-funded startups that crash and burn often make headlines. With serious money often comes serious scrutiny.', 'Big-time investments can supercharge the startup (for better or worse), but slow growth can ensure you have a sane, happy personal life — even as you build a thriving business. Here’s why.', 'Most people think success requires 16-hour days. Typically, the opposite is true. Busy and effective are not the same thing — even though “busyness” has become a modern-day status symbol.', '“Hustle might move you forward, but it doesn’t set you up for sustainable success,” says Kyle Young, author of QuitterProof. “Good habits are formed through consistency and repetition, not mindless effort.”', 'Many of the world’s greatest innovators (past and present) dedicated large amounts of time to simply thinking. Reflecting. Strategizing and planning. Bill Gates originally made the Think Week famous. Now, other founders, like Skillshare’s Mike Karnjanaprakorn, have adopted this practice. Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Ferrriss have also followed suit.', 'Taking a digital sabbath can also keep you feeling rested and ready to play the long game. On Saturday, Sunday or another day of your choice, avoid technology in all forms. For example, power down your laptop and place it safely out of sight. Shut off your smartphone and hide it in a drawer. Change your Netflix password — and then try to forget it. Give your brain the gift of peace, and the time to reflect and generate new ideas.', '51: That’s how many games Mikael and Niklas Hed created before they launched Angry Birds , which saved their company, Rovio, from bankruptcy.', '25: That’s how many publishers rejected Tim Ferriss’ The Four-Hour Workweek before Harmony Books offered him a contract. The 2007 title has now sold over 1.3 million copies to date.', '9: That’s how many months Anna Wintour spent at Harper’s Bazaar before she was fired, apparently for producing photo shoots that were “too edgy.” Wintour went on to become one of the most powerful women in fashion, serving as Vogue magazine’s editor-in-chief for over 40 years.', 'Founders are often hungry for success, but it takes time. Often, lots of time. A sustainable business model gives you the freedom to enjoy the ride. You can focus on building something you love, and that truly serves your customers, instead of racing toward empty growth targets.', '“So, what’s your exit strategy?”', 'Entrepreneurs often hear this question before they’ve earned a single dollar — and it can be disorienting. When you’re still building a business you love, why would you think about selling it?', 'Just as there are marked differences between bootstrapped and VC-backed founders, “exit strategies” often divide entrepreneurs into two camps: those building to sell, and those who are in it for the long run.', 'Either scenario has merit. Business is personal, and we all need to make our own choices. Although some bootstrappers will eventually sell their firms, they rarely begin with this goal in mind.', '“What’s better than an exit strategy?” says Todoist founder Amir Salihefendic. “It’s a long-term mission that your company truly cares about. It’s focusing on building a company that can outlast you and creating something of true value.”', 'Create value first and valuation will follow. Bootstrapping forces you to develop a product that’s worth paying for instead of trying to reach the top of TechCrunch or building a house of cards on a shaky foundation.', 'As I mentioned in Building my startup for 12 years: how to win the long game , you can retain your values, freedom and flexibility. You can learn from a slow-burning journey. You can focus on the long-term rather than the short.', 'A study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that unicorns (private companies valued above $1 billion) are roughly 50% overvalued. They’re not generating billions of dollars in revenue, but thanks to deep-pocketed investments, paper valuations swell to reach that 10-figure sum.', 'Relying purely on estimates can be risky, because a sky-high valuation demands rapid scaling. And if the sky suddenly falls, VC-backed startups are often left in a vulnerable position. As Warren Buffet once said, “It’s only when the tide goes out that you can see who’s been swimming naked.”', 'The media may glorify fast movers and big wins, but playing the long game is another type of victory. In fact, slow growth doesn’t have to be a mere consequence of bootstrapping; it can be a smart, deliberate choice.', 'If you measure success against lofty goals, it’s easy to feel discouraged along the way and devastated if you don’t reach them at all. Instead, each new milestone can be something to celebrate.', '“There is power in small wins and slow gains,” says James Clear. “This is why average speed yields above average results. This is why the system is greater than the goal.”', 'It’s worth exploring asking yourself:', 'For many bootstrappers, a harmonious work culture, plus total creative and financial freedom is the ultimate compensation.', 'In the hard-driving startup world, “culture” can be a cliché topic. Tech companies became infamous for installing foosball tables and offering craft beer on tap in exchange for gruelling work schedules. Superficial perks don’t foster culture — or a healthy work-life balance.', 'At JotForm, we aim to work in a way that’s sane, friendly and open. We keep normal hours and try to treat each other with deep respect. We also believe actions speak louder than words.', 'Enron Corporation — the American energy, commodities and services company — had four stated values: respect, integrity, communication and excellence. But those “official” values didn’t save the company from a high-profile bankruptcy and auditing scandal that sent several top executives to prison.', 'Culture grows through big choices, like team structure, transparency, and product-focused goals. It also emerges through smaller actions, like when the founder preaches balance and leaves the office by 6 pm every night.', 'As you begin to grow and hire a team, here are five ways to encourage a rich, healthy startup culture:', 'Bootstrapping is just one way to build a business. Capital-intensive industries such as energy, transportation, telecommunications, and brick-and-mortar stores and restaurants often require funding. VC backing might also be the best way to achieve your business goals and personal ambitions.', 'For anyone who’s eager to control their entrepreneurial destiny, bootstrapping can be an excellent choice. It worked for me, and I hope it can work for you, too.', 'Yes, it takes patience, drive, and determination. But the payoffs can include freedom (both financial and personal) and a better sense of work-life balance. You can grow at a sane pace and maintain a healthy personal life.', 'A self-funded business can also achieve great financial success. It might take more time, but the journey is often far more enjoyable. You can develop a product that improves people’s lives and build a top-notch team to help you along the way. You don’t have to feel like an imposter, either, because there’s time to learn and evolve with your business, not in spite of it.', 'Slow, sustainable growth is possible.', 'Stay focused on your product, trust in your abilities, and ask for help when you need it.', 'You can do this.', 'Originally published at https://www.jotform.com on July 8, 2019.']

You’re probably making your share of cash right now. That means you already know how to do it, right? That’s one of the first things I learned about money.', 'You have to look at making money as something you already know how to do. If you have a job or ever had a job, you know how to do it. Now, making more money on your own, that’s the next step.', 'But if you think it’s impossible, you’ll never do it. You need to stop thinking that only the privileged or fortunate ones can earn more. That’s not only false but it’s also self-sabotage.', 'Also, what’s your reason to earn more? You need a real drive to make money. Why? Because it’s hard and most people give up quickly.

For some people, it’s never enough. With that in mind, let’s get into a list of 5 ways you can start earning more money.

But anything that requires your advice, knowledge, and skills, falls under “monetizing knowledge.”', 'This has everything to do with your mindset. “But I don’t know anything.” Firstly, I doubt that because almost everyone has skills and strengths.

There are freelancing networks, teaching jobs, co-working places, and other ways you can get help to get started. Or, you can do everything yourself, as I do.', '“Wait, what? You’re supposed to tell me how to make more.” Well, call me old school, but I look at avoiding losses like money made. It’s no surprise that Warren Buffett’s #1 money rule is never to lose money.', 'You’ll appreciate this rule when you lose money that you easily could’ve kept. In practice, this rule is simple: Don’t be lured by get-rich-quick schemes.', 'Don’t blindly follow money trends; that’s how bubbles are created. Every year, there are new trends that everyone talks about.', 'My rule is very simple: If people talk about money making ideas on birthday parties, I’m out.', 'Also, when an opportunity to make money presents itself and you think, “This is too good to be true,” always walk away. Your future self will thank you for it.', 'Got extra cash laying around? Buy rental property in a city that you know. As you know, real estate is all about location.

It’s fine if affiliate marketing blends into your business, but I would never become a full-time affiliate marketer.', 'You have no skin in the game.

I have worked for 6.5 years at Amazon across multiple organizations and geographies. For the past one month, I have been working with the Data R&D organization of Uber at Seattle.', 'This post addresses the question my friends and colleagues have asked me, “What is the difference in working at Amazon vs. Uber?”', 'Engineering culture of a company cannot be defined in broad strokes as it is unique to every team and every org. The thoughts presented in this post are based on my observation working with specific teams and organizations and do not represent the broader company culture.', 'This post does not reflect upon my rationale to make the first company switch in my career and hence, the content should not be interpreted as such.', 'There are multiple commonalities and contrasts between the work culture at both the companies. Some of these can be attributed to the relative size of the companies while others are inherent & unique to the DNA of companies themselves. I am going to outline some noteworthy differences that I have encountered.', 'DevOps hustle is everywhere. Trying to maintain high availability for your services while not impeding rapid pace of innovation and continuous production releases is a hard problem to solve. Even more so, when we are talking about the massive scale at which Amazon and Uber operates. Both companies have a laser sharp focus on operational excellence, but while Amazon has long established, mature processes towards addressing the problem, Uber is still still experimenting with what strategy works best for them.', 'Amazon might be notorious (unfairly if I may add, see SIDENOTE#1) for heavy ops burden on software engineers with round the clock pager duty & on-call support, the reality is (IMO) that every company with a little ounce of customer obsession would take the reliability of its systems very seriously and Uber is no exception to that. Hence, DevOps hustle at Uber is no different than at Amazon, maybe even more, owing to rapid growth of the newly minted platforms & loosely structured operational processes.', 'Usage of OSS is perhaps the biggest difference that jumped out as a surprise to me when I joined Uber. Uber is an open source first company. This is reflected from its choice of internal tools and technologies to its impressive track record of giving back to the community [see SIDENOTE#2].', 'Building the internal infrastructure around open source technologies gives developers freedom to choose the right tool for the job and spend their energy in solving business problems where innovation is required. This also means that you have a diverse network of developers over the internet to help when stuck trying to debug an issue with a third party library. In contrast, working at Amazon which relies mostly on in-house developed infra & tools, narrows down your list of options to choose the correct tools and limits the amount of support options you have when stuck with an issue.', 'Instead of building every developer productivity tool itself (for monitoring, dashboarding, paging, recruiting), Uber licenses a lot of tools from companies which provide Software As A Service. These smaller companies with a focused portfolio tend to have better software for their domain that any in-house developed tooling. As a developer, this gives you the latest & the greatest tools to boost your productivity and improve software development lifecycle. This also frees up developers to focus on developing software for business problems & features unique to Uber.', 'At Uber, there is a weekly hands-on with the company leadership where the execs answer questions from employees. In addition to that there are periodic all-hands at every level of the executive chain.', 'As a developer, this gives you transparency around the rationale behind the decisions made that impact you & your work. This helps you align your work more closely with the company objectives and ensures that you are spending your energy trying to solve the right problems. It also gives you visibility into the challenges that exist beyond your immediate team or org. Coupled with the strong emphasis on documentation, this gives you an opportunity to get the answer to every “why” that you might have around any decision (technical or not) made. As a hypothetical example, if I have a question on “Why is Uber leaning towards Go over Java? or Why is my org structured the way it is?”, there would be a document which is accessible to me explaining the reason in great detail.', 'Such degree of transparency pertaining to every decision whether technical or not is refreshing and is extremely helpful during on-boarding to your team & understanding the state of the existing infrastructure. In contrast, at Amazon, the level of transparency was exposed on a need to know basis.', 'I miss the days of getting an auto scaling, fully managed MySQL compatible database on the click on a button. While working at AWS, I underestimated the simplicity that the cloud Infrastructure As A Service (IaaS) has brought in the development lifecycle of a software engineer. Using the cloud services comes at a cost and, at Uber, while you can use any technology that you need to get the job done, you have to justify the cost of paying a cloud vendor vs. managing/developing on your own.', 'Due to the small headcount at the Seattle engineering office of Uber, the work place feels tightly knit where you personally know people other than co-workers in your immediate team. The social events during lunch hours and the cultural site-wide events play an important role in bringing the feeling of togetherness as a unit. In contrast, Amazon operates in small functional units where your social interaction is limited to your two-pizza team (unless you make an extra effort to join company wide events which are always overcrowded).', 'Both the companies are not very different in the kind of engineering challenges that you would solve. In either case, you would have a business use case which cannot be solved by existing solutions due to the scale and availability requirements (perhaps the requirements for AWS might be greater than Uber’s in different domains). The business problems at these companies might be different but from an engineering perspective, at the end of the day, you are designing systems which work at a larger scale, are more robust, simpler to use and faster than the existing solutions. These solutions are tailored to fit the exact business use case which can be complex and diverse across these companies. Perhaps, the contrast lies in the number of engineers dedicated to solve a problem. A two pizza team working on a problem at Amazon would probably have a single developer working on the solution at Uber.', 'At Amazon, this is a topic which is heavily influenced by the org you are working on and the direction set by the executive leadership. I have experienced involvement ranging from no visibility into the data behind a top down mandated project requirement to having complete involvement via an engineering led round table discussion for the 2–5 year plans for a technical product. At Uber, every decision associated with the internal product that I own rests with me, right from identifying the gaps to defining success metrics. With my limited exposure at Uber, this seems to be the norm in my org rather than an anomaly (it is a platform org, not a product org) and ties to the point of a single person having more ownership at Uber than at Amazon.', 'At Amazon, I used to work at the HQ in Seattle where all the stakeholders, partners and upstream dependencies were accessible in person with a 10 minute walk, whereas at Uber, my stakeholders & dependencies are distributed across geographies. This particular point is very specific to the teams I worked with at either companies, but is nevertheless a big change I felt in terms of my work. With remote dependencies and stakeholders, one has to make extra effort to bring together the synergies. Video calls do not fully substitute the advantages of in-person meetings & discussions. Neither do occasional cross office visits replace the home advantage of having everyone you work with within the same office space.', 'Uber encourages the software engineers to seek and solve problems outside their immediate work domain and team’s charter. If you identify an engineering problem that you want to tackle and it would benefit Uber, the management is very likely to allow you to spend time in solving that problem even if that problem scope is outside the team’s ownership. In contrast, at Amazon, it is difficult to get visibility of the challenges being faced at other orgs and hence, difficult to work on a problem without actually moving to a different team.', 'Amazon does not provide free lunch to its employees and its offices do not have cafes where you can purchase wholesome lunch daily, while Uber has company provided free catered lunch with rotating daily cuisines.

If the ketogenic diet can reverse diabetes, why isn’t…	3K	36	https://medium.com/@pipersteele	https://medium.com/swlh/what-if-they-cured-diabetes-and-no-one-noticed-keto-diet-ketogenic-virta-study-d49c195bf8f5?source=collection_archive---------8-----------------------	9	1	['What If They Cured Type 2 Diabetes and No One Noticed?']	71	['When Sami Inkinen was diagnosed with pre-diabetes in 2012, he wasn’t an overweight couch potato. Far from it. The founder of real estate website Trulia was an elite athlete, earning the title of Half Ironman World Champion in his age group the year before.', '“I didn’t understand how it was possible,” Inkinen said about the diagnosis in a 2017 interview with Forbes. “I had thought that diabetes was a disease of uneducated, lazy people who had no willpower.”', 'Over the next few years, Inkinen would learn a lot more about diabetes — that it affects over 30 million people in the U.S. and that an estimated one in three adults has pre-diabetes (although 90% don’t know it).', 'He would learn that diabetes can kill, leading to kidney failure, loss of vision, blindness, lower limb amputation, heart attack and stroke if untreated. And he’d learn that it’s expensive. Treatment costs an average of $16,752 per person annually.', 'So you’d think that if someone figured out a way to reverse this horrible disease, there would be big bold headlines in 72-point type. You’d think the medical community, politicians and popular press would be shouting it from the rooftops.', 'Guess what? Someone did. Yet it appears no one noticed.', 'The cure was simple — so simple, in fact, that it involved no medication, no expensive surgery and no weird alternative supplements or treatments.', 'What was this miracle intervention? Diet. Specifically, the ketogenic diet.', 'After Inkinen’s pre-diabetes diagnosis in 2012, he spent the next few years researching the disease and treatments and ultimately teaming up with Stephen Phinney, MD, Ph.D in 2014 to form Virta Health, a research and virtual medical clinic whose mission is to reverse type 2 diabetes.', 'Phinney has been researching the keto diet and publishing studies on it for over 40 years. But last month, Virta published the results of what may be the most comprehensive study of the diet yet, a two-year intervention tracking 349 people who were divided into two groups. One followed a keto diet, the other followed their usual care for diabetes.', 'The results are impressive. At the end of two years, the keto group saw incredible improvements: 55% were able to reverse their diabetes and stop all medications except Metformin, and 18.5% were able to achieve remission. That is, they were both officially out of the diabetic range and off of all diabetes medications. Plus they maintained that state for at least one year.', 'The keto dieters were also able to lose weight (an average of 12% of body weight), reduce their dependence on insulin — dosages dropped 81% — and reduce triglycerides, inflammation and other markers for metabolic syndrome.', 'By contrast, just 10.5% of the participants in the control group were able to reverse their diabetes, and none was able to achieve full remission.', 'The control group also gained an average of 5% of their body weight, had a 13% increase in insulin dosages, and saw only modest improvements in triglycerides, inflammation and metabolic syndrome markers.', 'It’s also worth noting that this research is entirely self-funded — Virta receives its funding from venture capital investors.', 'The publication of this study should be enough for doctors and the medical associations to recommend a ketogenic diet for diabetics. Yet the response so far has been…crickets.', 'Ok, not entirely crickets. To be fair, earlier this year, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) did finally recommend a low carb diet as an option for treating diabetes. Previously, the ADA insisted that low carb diets are “unsafe,” since the brain “needs” 130 grams of dietary carbohydrate per day.', 'But most doctors have been unwilling to recommend keto to their patients, whether for diabetes, weight loss or anything other than treating epilepsy in children. This is surprising, given the wealth of studies on how low carb, high fat diets affect cardiovascular disease, weight loss and other metabolic disorders.', 'Why?', 'I think there are a number of factors at play. These include:', '1. Doctors don’t know much about nutrition.', 'It’s ironic that most of us turn to our doctors for advice about what we eat, since they receive very little education about nutrition — often less than 10 hours on the subject in all of medical school.', 'Moreover, many doctors — like many people — have entrenched views on nutrition that are based on cultural and intellectual bias, not scientific data. These ideas just feel right.', 'The idea that vegetarian or vegan diets are healthier than other diets is an example of this. So is the idea that a low fat diet is healthier than a high fat/low carb diet, despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary.', '2. Doctors don’t want to be perceived as crazy.', 'In some ways, the ketogenic diet is a victim of its own success. Though it has been around since the 1920s, it gained popularity recently among body builders, celebrities and the average Joe and Jane who want to lose weight.', 'Because of this, keto is viewed as a fad (at best) or dangerous (at worst) by many in the medical community.', 'For example, an article in the Harvard Health Letter from October 2018 titled, “Should you try the keto diet?” has as its subhead, “It’s advertised as a weight-loss wonder, but this eating plan is actually a medical diet that comes with serious risks.”', 'The article goes on to quote Kathy McManus, director of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who says that keto can result in nutritional deficiencies.', '“If you’re not eating a wide variety of vegetables, fruits, and grains, you may be at risk for deficiencies in micronutrients, including selenium, magnesium, phosphorus, and vitamins B and C,” McManus says.', 'I find this interesting because when I compare a ½-lb. hamburger to a ½ cup of broccoli, the hamburger has far more nutrients.', 'Sure, broccoli is loaded with vitamins A and C, providing 24% and 84% of daily requirements, respectively, plus folate (21% of daily requirements) and vitamin K (138% of daily requirements).', 'But the hamburger has 47% of niacin, 17% of riboflavin, 32% of B6, 69% of B12, 12% of B5, 24% of iron, 9% of magnesium, 17% of potassium, 35% of phosphorous, 66% of zinc, and 46% of selenium required daily.', 'While the Harvard Health Letter frequently recommends limiting red meat, which could actually result in significant B-vitamin deficiencies, the keto diet could include both the hamburger and the broccoli, providing quite a nutritionally complete meal.', 'Still, many doctors don’t want to recommend it because they don’t want to be seen as nut jobs who chase fads.', '3. Doctors don’t want to get in trouble.', 'At the moment, keto isn’t a standard treatment for diabetes or anything really, except epilepsy in children.', 'That puts doctors in an awkward position. If they don’t adhere to a standard of care, they could get into legal trouble with their practices, hospitals, insurance companies, licensing boards or patients.', 'So if an intervention, like a diet, isn’t part of the customary practice for treating a particular malady, doctors could run into problems recommending it.', 'This actually happened to Dr. Tim Noakes, a South African M.D. and professor of exercise science and sports medicine at the University of Cape Town. After offering the advice that breastfed babies should be weaned onto a high fat, low carb diet, the Health Professionals council of South Africa accused him of “unprofessional conduct,” resulting in a trial in which Noakes could have lost his medical license.', 'He ended up being exonerated, but his trial surely gave many doctors pause.', '4. Powerful organizations in the agricultural and pharmaceutical industries stand to lose big bucks if people shun bread, sugar, pasta and insulin in favor of eggs and bacon.', 'To be sure, there are the entities with a vested interest in keeping dietary advice as it is. An admission that keto actually has the power to reverse a major disease that plagues millions worldwide is also an admission that keto is a healthy way of eating (at least for the one-third of American adults with this disease and possibly others).', 'Such an admission would almost necessitate changing the U.S. dietary guidelines. This doesn’t seem like a big deal, but these guidelines direct how money is spent on everything from medical research to government-funded school lunches to which products are developed and marketed by the food industry.', 'We didn’t get Snackwells because people demanded overly sweet cardboard-like cookies. We got Snackwells because the U.S. adopted a low-fat dietary standard.', 'There are billions of dollars in whole grain breads and diabetes medications at stake here, and doctors who depend on research grants from these organizations may be loath to rock the boat.', 'I am not suggesting that doctors would knowingly recommend dietary advice that is unsound, but simply that they may have an unconscious bias toward standard, old-fashioned dietary advice, especially if their funding depends on supporting it.', 'Dr. Robert Cialidini is a social psychologist and expert on the science of persuasion. One of his key principles of influence is consistency — that is, people tend to behave in ways that are consistent with things they’ve already said or done.', 'Make no mistake: This social psychological principle is powerful. Cialdini says that the more public, voluntary and active a statement or action is, the more likely a person is to continue behaving in ways that support that statement or action.', 'So if you’re a doctor and you’ve already stated your view that say, a plant-based diet is healthier than a meat-based diet, it’s going to be hard to shift gears.', 'But it’s going to be even harder — perhaps nearly impossible — to change course if you’re the head of a prestigious medical association, the editor of a nutrition journal or a researcher at an Ivy League university.', 'Why? Because:', 'a) you have authority,', 'b) you’ve likely put your views in writing,', 'c) you may have given speeches in support of that view, and', 'd) you may have authored papers, conducted studies and/or taught classes that support that view.', 'In other words, it’s not that the doctors who don’t want to embrace keto are bad scientists. It’s not even about fear of looking foolish for changing their minds. Rather, I think it’s a natural human instinct to try to preserve internal consistency.', 'Actually, most of the doctors who are leaders in the keto community started out as devotees of low-fat, high carbohydrate diets.', 'So what made them change? It’s simple: Personal experience.', 'Before Dr. Noakes began recommending a low carb, high fat diet, he recommended the exact opposite. An avid runner and author of over 750 scientific books and articles, he frequently wrote about the benefits of carbohydrates for athletes and even helped develop a carbohydrate gel for endurance runners.', 'Then he found himself 50 pounds overweight and diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. His own father had died of complications of the disease.', 'Suddenly, the impact of a low-fat, high carbohydrate diet became personal. That’s when Noakes, an A1-rated scientist, dove seriously into researching diet and became a leading voice in the keto/low carb community.', 'He’s not alone. Many low carb and keto doctors had a similar path, including:', '— Dr. Georgia Ede, a Harvard-trained psychiatrist, discovered that eating low carb relieved her chronic fatique syndrome, fibromyalgia, migraines and IBS;', '— Dr. Ken Berry, author of Lies My Doctor Told Me and YouTube keto vlogger, found that he simply couldn’t lose weight following the traditional low-fat diet, but keto helped him lose weight and improve his fitness;', '— Dr. John Limansky, an internist an avid exerciser who was always thin discovered in his 20s that he was on the road to diabetes and high blood pressure from eating a low fat diet;', '— Dr. Tro Kalajian, an internist and obesity medicine specialist, who grew up obese and ultimately lost 150 pounds and became ripped on a low carb ketogenic diet;', '— Dr. Brian Lenzkes, an internist who battled weight gain for most of his life, trying to treat it by eating six small low-fat meals a day and working out six days a week to no avail until finally discovering keto and intermittent fasting.', 'and many more.', 'Perhaps the tide is turning. It needs to. There is plenty of sound research to support keto and low carb diets as methods to improve health. My hope is that others will review this research with an open mind.', 'Like this story and want more? Sign up for my newsletter now!']

It is a Supervised Machine Learning where the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter.', 'To understand the concept of Decision Tree consider the above example. Let’s say you want to predict whether a person is fit or unfit, given their information like age, eating habits, physical activity, etc. The decision nodes are the questions like ‘What’s the age?’, ‘Does he exercise?’, ‘Does he eat a lot of pizzas’? And the leaves represent outcomes like either ‘fit’, or ‘unfit’.', 'What we’ve seen above is an example of classification tree, where the outcome was a variable like ‘fit’ or ‘unfit’. Here the decision variable is Categorical/ discrete.', 'Such a tree is built through a process known as binary recursive partitioning. This is an iterative process of splitting the data into partitions, and then splitting it up further on each of the branches.', 'Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees. (e.g. the price of a house, or a patient’s length of stay in a hospital)', 'In this method a set of training examples is broken down into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree get incrementally developed. At the end of the learning process, a decision tree covering the training set is returned.', 'The key idea is to use a decision tree to partition the data space into cluster (or dense) regions and empty (or sparse) regions.', 'In Decision Tree Classification a new example is classified by submitting it to a series of tests that determine the class label of the example. These tests are organized in a hierarchical structure called a decision tree. Decision Trees follow Divide-and-Conquer Algorithm.', 'Decision trees are built using a heuristic called recursive partitioning. This approach is also commonly known as divide and conquer because it splits the data into subsets, which are then split repeatedly into even smaller subsets, and so on and so forth until the process stops when the algorithm determines the data within the subsets are sufficiently homogenous, or another stopping criterion has been met.']

For the first time in history people over 65 outnumbered children under five in 2018.', 'As we live longer thanks to technology, in the near future there will be a need for senior citizens to talk to. The walker/talker job will be just that — talking to elderly in need of companionship, listening to them talk and taking the more mobile of them for a walk. This will be great for people that like to listen and interact with their fellow human beings.', 'Since the 1980s, worldwide obesity has nearly doubled with just over 200 million adult men and just under 300 million adult women obese. In the U.S. alone, it is expected that nearly half of the population will be obese by 2030. In 2004 the World Health Organization adopted the “WHO Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health” and later the “Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases 2013–2020” in an attempt to halt the rise of obesity.', 'As a direct consequence from the problem of obesity the fitness commitment counselor position will emerge. Although we have a lot of technology to track and help with daily movement, such as fitbits, it still can’t go the full length as it can’t hold the wearer accountable for their health. In the future clients will not only wear an activity tracker, but also have a fitness commitment counselor to keep them motivated and on track to better health.', 'The growth of AI is expected to explode and its impact on society and the economy will be significant. Healthcare won’t escape the change as researchers are currently looking into ways that AI can be incorporated, such as a more effective way of diagnosing diseases. From this the AI-assisted healthcare technician position will arise, according to Cognizant.', 'This position is pretty much nursing updated. The skills required are the same health care skills but with an added tech savviness to deliver them remotely, using in-home testing equipment and tools to diagnose and treat ailments, which will allow doctors to support these technicians and handle the harder cases directly. It will also be possible to perform surgery with the help of AI, with no medical degree needed.', 'Rapid urbanization is leading to smarter cities that aim to improve the lives of citizens through technology. Such cities aren’t just a trend, they are the future because the world is becoming more urab with 68 percent of the population expected to live in cities by 2050, according to the UN. Worldwide, smart city technology spending was $80 billion in 2016, and is expected to grow to $135 billion by 2021, according to a report from the International Data Corporation.', 'As the number of smart cities increases, cyber city analysts will keep the tech up and running, much like electricians maintain the infrastructure of the power grid today. The data collected from the millions of sensors across such a city that keep the services working will need to be kept working and this is where the cyber city analyst comes in.', 'The future holds the marvels of gene-editing technologies and the use of Crispr, a gene-editing tool that holds enormous potential to accelerate life science research, improve biotechnology, and even treat diseases, will take off in the future as predicted by Cognizant. This will give rise to many companies that will use such technologies to create new medicines at incredible rates.', 'A genomic portfolio director is the executive that will lead such a company and decide on what products need to be created. The individual in this position will have the task to create a strategy to market the new creations to the consumers and will have to ensure that the company keeps its foot on the gas.', 'Even today there is a need for good collaboration between man and machine, especially in factories. In the future, when there is a higher number of robots has increased significantly there will be a need for someone to be a referee of sorts between the partnership of man and machine.', 'The teamin manager will have to figure out and combine the strengths of man (cognition, judgment, empathy, versatility, etc.) and machine (accuracy, endurance, computation, speed, etc.) to create the most productive worker team possible. Companies will be on the hunt for individuals that will be able to develop an “interaction system through which humans and machines mutually communicate their capabilities, goals, and intentions, and devising a task planning system for human-machine collaboration.”', 'Keeping track of your finances is hard now, but in the future, when cash becomes obsolete and electronic currencies such as bitcoin rule and automated loans and micro-payments are normal, it will be even trickier. There will be a lot of potential for “money leakage” and the fee structures of this new system will be far too complicated for the average person to understand.', 'Financial wellness coaches will have to help people keep track of their digital transactions and make the most of their money. “In the face of increasingly digital finance transactions, many banking customers are too time-crunched to fully understand fee structures and optimal approaches to financial management,” states Cognizant.', 'E-commerce market was worth more than $500 billion in the U.S. in 2018 alone and are projected to surpass $735 billion by 2023. The traditional jobs aren’t going to disappear but will get a digital update and the digital tailor is just that.', 'According to Cognizant, companies will require digital tailors that will make use of cutting-edge technology to take customers’ measurements, the clothes will then be produced and the tailors will return for a final fitting to ensure lower return rates through selling customers perfectly fitting clothes.', 'The future holds immense interconnectivity between investors and companies will have no choice but to be fully transparent. Because of an increase of secret cryptocurrency transactions suspicion will be abundant and this is where the trust officer will step in.', 'These individuals will be responsible for clearing suspicion and showing investors that the money they are putting into the company is used with the utmost integrity. Companies will need individuals with “the combined financial and regulatory acumen needed to deal in traditional and cryptocurrencies, with the PR expertise to maintain a positive public image that upholds our organization’s financial and public integrity.”', 'Companies are investing billions in quantum computing and the amount is expected to reach $5.8 billion globally by 2025, according to a report by Allied Market Research. The next step would be to integrate machine learning and quantum information. This will require a whole different type of analyst.', 'The quantum machine learning analyst will be responsible for combining these for better and faster solutions to real-world problems. The end goal of these analysts will be to create a system that can learn from data and this role will be suitable for the most highly skilled individuals.', 'With retail moving ever faster to being online, in the future it can be expected that it will be fully online, with real-life stores disappearing. To help customers pick out the best item they need, for example a new dining table, the virtual sherpa will connect to them through virtual reality and will talk to them about their needs, advise them on products and finally dispatch a robot to deliver the item decided on.', 'This is pretty much being a shop assistant in the future, just online. There sherpa will not need a specific degree for this and will just help customers get the product that they need.', 'Companies like Facebook and Google make a lot of money from selling our personal information to companies. Cognizant imagines a future where you will have full control over your personal data, meaning that you can make money off of it.', 'The personal data broker will have a simple job — to make sure their customers receive money from the companies they sell their data to. The person in this position will monitor and trade personal data on a newly created data exchange.', 'Cognizant expects that advances in memory and other brain-related healthcare will lag behind the increased life expectancy of people. To decrease the stress of senior citizens from their longevity it will be necessary to use virtual reality to create worlds for them to inhabit.', 'The personal memory curator will use the experiences of people to create realistic simulations of their past. Curators will also be responsible for managing the “advance memory statement” before the onset of memory fail.', 'The development of augmented reality will allow for greater entertainment experience for the population of the future. It will allow for immersive storytelling and world creation that a person can live through.', 'The augmented reality journey builder will take customers on a journey, much like great authors do with their stories. This job will require the writing, designing and building the augmented reality experiences and most importantly the personalization of the next generation of stories.', 'Many companies are developing AI cars and Cognizant believes that the future holds a fundamentally different infrastructure of both roads and air space. The regulation will be vastly different from the one currently in place and will necessitate someone to direct and manage it.', 'Highway controllers will take on this mantle and will have to monitor, regulate, plan and manipulate both air and road space by monitoring and programming the AI platforms that control the vehicles. This position can be equated to an air traffic controller, but on steroids with an added bonus of even greater stress levels.', 'Technological advancement in the future will change the meaning of an equal opportunity employer from making sure they have a diverse group of employees of ethnic, gender and sexual orientation to making sure there is a good mix of people who have been genetically enhanced and those who haven’t.', 'The theory that junk data is useless is a rather flawed one. Even if data hasn’t been used in the past year, it has the potential to be turned into useful insights. Just like trash can be recycled and used again, so can junk data.', 'The job of the data trash engineer will be to identify unused data, clean it up and feed it into machine-learning algorithms to find hidden insights by not only increasing how much data is collected, but also improving the data quality. The end goal is to transform trash into treasure.', 'The evolution of war will move from the physical battlegrounds in to virtual ones. This is already happening with the election interference in the 2016 U.S. election and the 2015 Ukraine power outage.', 'Cyber agents won’t just be there to defend against outside attacks, but will also have to mount an offensive of their own. In this position you will have to develop and deliver strategic cyber offenses against enemy infrastructure and public and private sector systems. Cyber agents will need to have a “track record of cyber hacking, “grey-hat-focused” software development or distributed denial of service attack experience.”', 'Although cigarettes, alcohol and drugs will by no means disappear in the near future, the youth of that time will have a vastly different array of temptations compared to today. In the future, the easy money and seemingly victimless nature of cybercrime will attract a large number of youths into it.', 'Juvenile cybercrime rehabilitation counsellors will have to work closely with the young cyber offenders to help rehabilitate them. A counsellor will have to first understand the cyber talents and then direct them toward digital roles that will make the most use of their talents.', 'Siri, Alexa and Google Home might be serviceable, but they lack the colour and creativity of human conversation. There is a lot of room for improvement and with the development of AI voice platforms in the future it will be up to the voice UX designers to tailor an optimal dialect for the customer.', 'Cognizant believes that in the near future linguists will be much sought after in order to provide a very personal AI voice platform. If voice interfaces reflect a person’s dialect and individual speech traits it will be more effective and as such voice UX designers will be needed.', 'Even today there is an increased in the minimalist approach in the world, such as the Tiny Homes movement. In the future this will be gaining even more popularity, as people decrease the number of things they have as they are figuratively “drowning” in them.', 'The joy adjutants will have a simple mission — to help people make good decisions about objects that bring happiness to their lives. They will also help customers declutter and organize, by figuring out where to start when sorting out items.', 'The widespread adoption of sensors and biometric technology in the workplace will allow for the understanding of the behaviour of employees. However, this will be a very challenging and complex landscape as there will be vast amounts of data, such as performance data, emotional data and interaction data.', 'Making use of all this data, the head of business behaviour will analyse it and create strategies that will improve employee engagement, productivity, well-being and workplace happiness. This position will also require a vigilant oversight of the privacy and ethical concerns around the collection of behavioral data and preserve the employees’ trust.', 'Smart homes are already becoming a reality as they can be environmentally friendly, provide better security and safety, handle regular household tasks and provide a more entertaining home. In the future smart homes will become the norm and will require design managers.', 'Smart home design managers will work closely with architects, engineers and clients to “design connected homes that cocoon inhabitants in a fully and seamlessly connected environment, using the latest integrated technology in an aesthetically and environmentally friendly manner.” They will have to be on top of the latest technological trends and find original ways to integrate technology with both traditional and contemporary styles.', 'With the expected increase of AI use in businesses, it will be essential to ensure that the algorithms driving the AI are fair, legal and representative of the values of companies. Even today many of the biggest companies, such as Amazon and Google, rely on algorithms.', 'The algorithm bias auditor will have to conduct a methodological and rigorous review new and existing apps and systems within the organization and establish an inventory system that logs and tracks each algorithm, its objectives, its input and output, related human value judgments and consequences. The position will also require the establishment of guidelines and compliance methodologies that can easily be understood and followed by employees in an organization.', 'Cognizant believes that in the future universities will offer their alumni the possibility of lifelong learning. Coordinators will be needed to guide learners toward the best, most relevant programs for their individual needs and help them choose how to learn by offering personal advice and ensuring their learning plans are the perfect fit for them.', 'This position will also involve the use of a tool to collect data on lifelong learners to build an up-to-date learning profile and use predictive algorithms to make recommendations based on employment and skills data.', 'As it is important to know whether you will need an umbrella tomorrow through your weather forecast, it will be increasingly important to understand and predict cyber conditions in the future. Governments, industries, societies and individuals will need to protect themselves and become more resilient.', 'A cyber calamity forecaster will have to monitor, detect and forecast cyber threats and predict what their impact will be. Forecasters will also have to accurately map cyber uncertainties, make predictions to prepare for their occurrence and be able to distinguish between highly improbable and wildly impossible cyber outliers.', 'The explosive growth of Esports won’t be stopping anytime soon and the global games market is expected to generate $152.1 Billion in 2019. This means that Esports will grow and with competitions already filling arenas, especially in South Korea, esports fans will want to watch their favorite player or team live.', 'Design-and-build construction managers will be necessary to define all tasks needed for the build-out of esports arenas. They will have to be able to scope and manage more specialised operational roles, such as: “contracts for laying down the latest in innovative “smart” foundations; installing miles of specialty cables; erecting immersive cage gaming structures; installing lighting and cutting-edge electrical systems and building locations; designing biometric AR/VR displays (including haptic feedback); and massive state-of-the-art high definition screens that can expand or contract depending on crowd size, cultivating capacity driven intimacy.”', 'The warming of the world is a fact and climate change is threatening the world we live in. The expected rise of sea levels that will threaten every coastal city will have to be fought and the impact will need to be mitigated.', 'Tidewater architects will be responsible for the planning and execution of projects that work with nature — not against it. Excellence in hydro-engineering, civil engineering and architectural design derived from the principles of moats, floats, super-dikes and wetlands is essential to this role.', 'Advances in AI could soon make creating convincing fake audio and video — known as “deepfakes” — relatively easy. Making a person appear to say or do something they did not can take the war of disinformation to a whole new level. There is a need for ways to prevent this.', 'Virtual identity defenders will be capable of creating digital watermarks that can be authenticated and can prove the truth of something or someone and, conversely, signal an illegitimate intention in their absence.', 'Cognizant believes that the future of products, services and bots will be personalities that can establish a rapport with the consumers. This is where the head of machine personality design comes in. The person in this role will “inject the voice of the customer” into the machine personality brief, anywhere that the customer interfaces with a machine, product or service.', 'To do this, the head of machine personality design will use both quantitative and qualitative market analysis techniques. The role will also require the person to ensure a consistent branding experience across all automated points of contact and create an interface that has a personality.', 'Virtual reality is expected to grow rapidly and VR arcades will be able to provide immersive, high-definition multiplayer experiences. This is pretty much the same as computer clubs that used to exist before PCs were in every home. Cognizant seems to believe that VR will become bigger than TV and from this the necessity for VR arcade managers will come about.', 'A VR arcade manager will manage the physical arcade and will liaise with the central VR software developers to make sure the latest and greatest VR experience is available and operational at all times.', 'Even today consumers want their food to be fresh and delivered quickly. In the future this will be even more pronounced and while demand increases and the increasingly unpredictable impact that climate change has on produce there will be a need for vertical farms to address the need for stable, localized farming with aeroponic systems that grow food in controlled environments, unhindered by the impacts of global warming, while using a fraction of the water required by traditional farms.', 'The vertical farming consultants will tend to these farms and advise communities on the best practices so people can eat healthier and source food locally. Consultants will work with community leaders and local governments to identify the optimal locations for farming sites within neighborhoods and train residents to operate the facility. Other responsibilities will be to create educational plans that advise people on the health benefits of plant-based diets and how best to prepare meals that meet their needs.', 'As AI becomes part of every part of our lives, it will present unknown challenges that will be more pressing and surprising to us. From biased and unexpected results to dangerous errors, the unintended actions of intelligent machines and how these errors could have an impact on a company will have to be addressed.', 'To address this, machine risk officers will have to manage the potential risks that can occur when intelligent machines fail. This position will also require the establishment of human-machine trust and will have to also protect a company’s brand, reputation and finances by considering machine ethics issues.', 'Subscriptions play a large role today and in the future it can be expected that it will be even more impactful. From companies like the Dollar Shave Club, which delivers monthly supplies of razors and other personal grooming products, to HelloFresh that delivers healthy recipes along with pre-measured ingredients every week, many more companies will be present in the years to come.', 'This will require a subscription management specialist to construct a framework of linked subscriptions to establish and “advance customer familiarity, loyalty and a direct sales channel.” This position will be twofold — to investigate the “most suitable subscriptions for acquiring new customers, increasing the value of existing customers and reducing customer churn, while also undertaking micro-subscription service development by exploring opportunities to partner and develop a suite of micro-payment options for customers.”', 'Terrafugia, a Chinese-owned corporation, based in Woburn, MA, U.S., is currently developing a flying car that is supposed to go on sale in the U.S. this year. The future of the skies being filled with flying cars piloted by everyday citizens is slowly coming closer to fruition. Cognizant believes that this becoming a reality is close and the world will need aerospace and car engineers to make these vehicles a reality for the masses.', 'People with experience in engineering, software development, aeronautics, battery technologies, materials development and many other positions will be needed to assist in moving flying cars from the planning table to commercial development.', 'A haptic interface is a system that allows people to interact with a computer through bodily sensations and movements. Haptics are a type of human-computer interaction technology that “encompasses tactile feedback or other bodily sensations to perform actions or processes on a computing device.”', 'A haptic interface designer will use new materials and the ability to program responsive textures to maximize the impact of outreach campaigns. The role will also require the identification of which wearable and touch-surface platforms work best to combine and advertise a brand, product or service.', '“Purpose” is expected by Cognizant to become the new commercial battleground and as such believes that people will be needed to conceive, shape and launch dedicated purpose journeys. In this role a person will help clients build, maintain, manage and smooth out their purpose in the minds of an increasingly crowded market.', 'As a chief purpose planner you will conceive, shape and launch dedicated purpose journeys for companies.

There’s also the problem of not knowing where to begin. If you’re talented enough to go viral in one go, congrats, but this isn’t for you.', 'Organic growth happens when you begin interacting with accounts who have similar content, as well as their followers. Why do I recommend doing this? Well, if 30,000 people like this one dude’s content (which is just like yours), they’ll probably like yours, too!', 'There are so many YouTube videos, articles, and pricey online webinars claiming to provide people with Instagram success. Maybe all of these “go viral overnight” strategies are true, but I doubt it.', 'All the big accounts that I’ve studied on Instagram took a while to grow, unless they bought followers, went viral with one post, or have even follow-to-follower ratios.', 'Because my strategy is tedious, I haven’t tried it out on any other platform besides Instagram. I am an artist, so I also find this platform to be the best medium for my target audience, as it is visual.', 'However, I have repeated this process 3 times with different types of Instagram accounts. I have witnessed continued success.', 'How to generate 1,000 Instagram followers (organically) in about 2 months:', '1. For 3 or 4 days, search for content that looks similar to what you want to post and engage with it through likes and comments. You should do this so that your explorer page accurately depicts what you want to show/see.', '2. After a few days have passed, go to the explorer page and find someone who has similar content and a bigger following. It should be easy to find similar content now that you have told Instagram’s algorithm what interests you.', '3. Examine the quality of the posts. What are they doing differently? Perhaps they use the same filter on every photo (I don’t think that matters as much as people think it does, but meh) or they post every day at the same time.', 'Perhaps they’re super creative. Do they do giveaways, which ask for emails or likes/comments (ahem, engagement)? Whatever they’re doing, make a note of it and use it as a reference when your account grows.', '4. Find relevant Hashtags. Look at their hashtags and write down the ones they are using. Then, find another account like theirs, with a similar following and do the same thing. If it’s massive account, you might not see any hashtags. Check the first comment on the post, as some people put them there.', 'If you still don’t see any hashtags, scroll until you reach the beginning of their feed. If they grew organically, then they likely used them regularly at some point. Copy all of the hashtags, then paste them in a Google Doc or perhaps your e-mail notes.', '5. Use the hashtags properly. Now you should have a pool of quality, relevant hashtags to pull from. When you curate your next post, you’re going to draw from these hashtags. The key to avoid shadowbanning on Instagram is to avoid using the same hashtags every day (even if larger accounts do it). Bigger accounts generally don’t need to use hashtags for engagement. For them, it’s mostly about promotion.', 'Instagram operates on an algorithm that favors quality content, engagement, and non-spammy practices. With the new updates in place, Insta is continually checking for “robotic behavior” and could dock you for posting the same hashtags every day.', 'When I say dock, I mean that you wouldn’t show up in the feed for specific hashtags. This practice is similar to a website getting dinged on Google for duplicate content, so beware!', '6. Find followers with a genuine interest in your content. My advice is to look at slightly bigger accounts, perhaps with 1400–5000 followers. Follow all of the people that they are following, not their followers.', 'We want to keep your ratios at a reasonable place, but not while you grow. You’ve probably noticed that accounts which have more followers than they are following get a lot of praise, interaction, and brand deals. To get there, you need to find people who like the kind of content you’re producing.', '7. When you interact with posts, leave thoughtful comments. Don’t try to cut corners by automating your responses through a third-party system. I told you that this would be a tedious task, and I meant it.', 'You’re going to get what you put into this. If you leave trash comments, don’t expect genuine engagement/interest in your content. Why should someone care about your posts, when you don’t care about theirs?', 'One time, I had a mutual friend post an unfortunate story about a deceased family member. Someone was using automated comments and commented “So cool \U0001f970👌” on a deeply personal post — don’t be that guy.', '8. Repeat these steps every day for 30 days. On the 30th day, your engagement should be fantastic, but your follower-to-following ratios are going to look nuts. Your account will probably look something like this:', '9. Now it’s time to unfollow spam accounts and people that didn’t follow you back. This is the only place that I cut corners. I use two apps for this process, and they’re both free. I use Unfollow and Follower Track to see who unfollows me.', 'When I am ready to clean out my followers, I tap “Select Non-Followers,” and the system will provide me with a list of accounts that are not following me back.', 'I can then choose to “whitelist” the accounts that I wish to continue following, like Society6 or UrbanOutfitters, and can “action” to unfollow the rest. Instagram only lets you unfollow/follow a certain amount of people a day. To my understanding, the amount varies for every person.', 'This process will take forever, but it will possibly help your engagement and establish a decent follow-to-follower ratio. Technically, the ratio doesn’t matter in the grand scheme of things. However, having more followers than you follow can prevent people from using the “follow and then unfollow” practice.', 'So, there you have it. I’m certainly not a social media or SEO expert, but I have noticed that these practices work for me. Social media is a strange animal, and while everyone has their methods, there is one thing I know to be true:', 'I did this on my art Instagram account and have been invited to join 3 different art shows and made sales because of it. Be genuine, and things will pay off slowly!', 'I’m not selling anything, I promise. I’m merely providing people with a guide that I use to generate engagement and organic growth on my own Instagram accounts. I truly hope this helps.', 'If you have other methods that you use for social media growth, feel free to provide them below. And if you dig this guide, throw me 50 claps or something!']

Like the Titanic, nobody could have warned me of the icebergs I was steering towards, until I was already crashing towards an icy mental breakdown.', 'In 2014, freelancing was really taking off. I decided to quit my full-time job and go for it.', 'My first client was the company I had just quit. I agreed to work for them as a contractor until they replaced me. They paid $40/hour, 30 hours a week and I managed their Facebook Ads (400+ ads — it was the account that taught me a lot of what I know about Facebook Ads). What a warm welcome into the freelance world!', 'At that time, only the brave entered the world of no dress code, open hours, and no coworkers. We were a self-validated crew of ‘entrepreneurs’ simply because we found quotes on Pinterest that talked about ‘hustling’ while we scoffed at peasants working their stable, 9–5 jobs with benefits and a 401k.', 'I had also quietly departed from the sobriety train about three months prior to leaping into the freelance world. To be fair to myself, I would also get sober again, two years before quitting freelancing, but I am sure the confidence I had at the start of freelancing made me think I could also handle alcohol better than my history had proven.', 'Freelancing was, in the beginning, fantastic. It was freeing. It allowed me to travel whenever I wanted. I went to Europe for five weeks. I went camping whenever I wanted. I had unlimited cell phone data, so I could hotspot from my car if I needed to get work done.', 'I was also annoying to go on trips with, especially with friends who were using their bygone vacation time and had no emails to answer, no “can you do this real quick,” beckons to respond to, etc. They were actually off work. What a simple way to live! *scoff*', 'I began to forget what not working felt like. I took pride in the fact that I worked as much as I did. It made me feel important. My bank account had more digits, I could write everything off, and answered to no-one — except my clients.', 'For the most part, my clients were great. I had low-maintenance clients who always paid on time and always kept things in scope. These clients were a dream to work for.', 'Then there were the scope-creeping clients, who would bombard my inbox, send text messages, and ask for things we did not agree on. They often used multiple exclamation points in their emails — this is something that always raises my suspicion. Why do you need more than one exclamation point unless you are trying to passive-aggressively manipulate someone? Am I ridiculous for thinking this way?', 'It was, of course, my fault for not setting better boundaries. I should have always outlined in contracts that texting was never allowed. I should have always insisted on what my office hours were. But, I needed the money, so I was willing to work as much and do anything to keep my clients and obtain new ones.', 'I didn’t learn how to set professional boundaries until the last year of freelancing, and by then I was already on my way out because of poor-behaving clients, a surplus in the supply of available freelancers, and increasingly heightened anxiety with a side of deepening depression.', 'I once fired a client who wouldn’t quit texting or calling me anytime I had an extra space in between hashtags on his Instagram posts, or if I used hashtags that were not exactly describing the content (do you know how hashtags work, bruh?). He required that I revise photos four times before he would approve them, and then even after posting approved content to Instagram…he would delete them and request more revisions.', 'The major event that really broke me was when I quit working for an internationally-known non-profit that I actually loved being associated with, but could not deal with the founder any longer.', 'The non-profit was founded by a man who retired at ~39 years old (beware of ‘non-profits’ headed up by rich white men who can afford to retire before 40…). I was constantly questioned about marketing, was told that he knew what would work better because he had read 30 marketing books (vs. my 10+ years of experience), was questioned about the amount of time I would spend on my work (I work extremely efficient because I have been doing this for 10+ years and have developed systems & workflows — and yet it was not fast enough for him) all while paying me $22/hour and refusing to give me a raise, telling me I did not deserve a full bonus, even after taking over three departing team-members responsibilities, etc. etc. Other team members were treated the same way. We were not allowed to be the true experts we were, because he wanted things done his way. And, he paid at a minimum, because we were working for a ‘non-profit.’ He once reminded me that another coworker was also getting paid low, and she was happy to do the work. She had a full-time job. Freelancing was my bread and butter.', 'I started to hate marketing. I started to believe that I actually didn’t know what I was talking about. I became scared to do my work, because it would just get tossed out and overruled. I took a lot of depression/procrastination naps. Imposter syndrome, anyone?', 'I finally gave notice that I was ending my contract, because I wanted to quit working for $22/hr and free up space for something new to enter my world (do the math on self-employment tax; I was barely making minimum wage!).', 'I then allowed myself to be convinced to continue managing the website. I did it for $900/mo (this is cheap in the world of web dev), but was looking forward to using the website as a portfolio piece, because I was learning to code, and was excited to take the project on— until the founder continuously overruled design and layout suggestions, to create a somewhat functional and horrible UI/UX of a website. Using this site as a portfolio piece was an idea that quickly floated away, along with my willpower to care about this client.', 'Quitting that client was extremely freeing, but true damage had been done, and I am still recovering from it. Freelancing overall caused a lot of damage that feels like PTSD. This client was simply the loud, long, grande finale.', 'My last year as a freelancer was filled with anxiety, depression, naps (so many naps), poor eating habits, long runs, too much coffee, ridiculous sleeping patterns, or no sleep at all. And yet — people PRAISE this type of lifestyle (queue the Gary Vee followers). It is unhealthy to set no boundaries between yourself and work.', 'Although I was in therapy, my social anxiety started to get pretty bad. Previous disordered eating habits that I thought were long gone started to poke their head back into view. I started to experience symptoms of OCD: needing to clean every surface more than once, checking my door to see it was locked three, four, and five times before bed. All with a fairly consistent stream of manic, repetitive mumbling going on in my head.', 'But I was making a lot of music. *sigh*', 'One night, I was on the floor of my apartment crying when I started to look up phone numbers and addresses to mental clinics in my neighborhood. I needed to know where they were, because I knew I was breaking. I started cursing at myself: for letting myself get to this point, and because I realized I was starting to have a breakdown, which made me feel more panicked.', 'I had been applying for jobs in Seattle after moving from Denver in January. I knew I wanted to quit freelancing before I even moved. After applying for over 200 jobs, interviewing with no less than 25, the 100% rejection rate confirmed that I truly did not know what I was doing in the world of marketing. I was also having the most difficult time finding an apartment in Seattle.', 'I kept sinking. I even considered moving back to Texas, in with my parents. I had one client left, and wasn’t trying to find any new ones. I had no energy left.', 'Ultimately, I finally made the decision to talk to a doctor and he suggested & prescribed a prescription for Prozac.', 'Prozac was exactly what I needed. I am so thankful for it. Mental health stigma, as we all know, is alive and well. What is even more thriving is stigma around medication.', 'I have already heard plenty of opinions from people who don’t understand how SSRIs works…inform me that I should not be on medication. I am capable and ready to advocate for myself in these situations. I know that I made the right choice in deciding to take medication. I don’t need to convince anyone of that. The way I feel is proof to myself that it was the right decision.', 'I am still taking Prozac, and when I miss doses, I can feel why I still need to be on it. I hope to get off it at the end of this year, under the guidance of a doctor and therapist, of course.', 'I got a full-time job around the same time I started Prozac. I accepted a position at an independent hotel in Seattle as their marketing manager. It has been such a blessing, and the perfect farewell to freelancing.', 'Having a paycheck every other Friday, health benefits, and an office to go to everyday is an absolute treasure. I had forgotten the joy working with a team brings. It feels AMAZING to only have to focus on ‘one job,’ instead of 13. It’s also been enlightening to rediscover that I do know a thing or 587 about marketing. I am on a team that provides positive feedback instead of only negative. I cherish face-to-face interaction vs. misinterpreting someone’s tone in an email. I love leaving my work at the office.', 'My full time job is a blessing, not in disguise. I knew I was ready for it.', 'Freelancing is not what it was six years ago. It causes issues that are, in my opinion, not worth the benefits. There is no real accountability or incentive for bad clients to behave.', 'The constant weight that used to exist has now dissipated from the back of my mind, and has freed up space in my life to re-establish healthy habits. I can once again truly connect with people on other topics that don’t have anything to do with work, because I am separate from my job again. I’m not treating every person I meet like a prospect.', 'I know my freelancing story is not like everyone else’s. I know plenty of incredibly balanced, successful, strong freelancers. They are inspiring people I look up to. I think you should freelance if that is what works for you. It wasn’t working for me anymore.', 'If you have questions or comments about freelancing, meds, mental health, or anything I write about, feel free to shoot me an email: tiffinymcostello@gmail.com.']
08/2019	Here’s How to Deal with People Who Are Ghosting You	And why you should stop ghosting others	402	1	https://medium.com/@jakobryce	https://medium.com/swlh/heres-how-to-deal-with-people-who-are-ghosting-you-ccc7a724e463?source=collection_archive---------5-----------------------	7	1	['Here’s How to Deal with People Who Are Ghosting You']	11	['Intentionally ignoring a person without an explanation is one of the most passive aggressive forms of human behavior there is — it denotes a certain disdain for the person being ignored. It suggests a weakness of character and is a red flag that indicates an unresolved issue on behalf of the “ghoster.”', 'Ghosting is a becoming a growing communication phenomenon. Around fifty percent of men and women have experienced ghosting, with a large number carrying out the act. Even celebrities are getting involved — Anna Kendrick has been totally upfront about her ghosting. “I ghost everybody all the time. I’m the queen of the French exit.” According to the New York Times, ghosting is “The act of suddenly ceasing all communication with someone you are dating but no longer wish to date.” In its way, ghosting is a form of rejection without an explanation — no text, no call, no email, nada. It’s also a way for the ghoster to avoid accountability while hoping you get the hint.', 'But ghosting is not new — there have always been variations of ghosting in the past: no return letter, someone crossing the street or pretending they don’t know you, professional feuds, or the dreaded cold shoulder at a dinner party. In the past (at least pre-90s) you couldn’t ignore someone’s phone call because you didn’t know who was calling — you had to confront the person or hang up. Compare that to our tech-savvy, smartphone culture, where you now have the power to block (virtually erase) someone. Ghosting has become incredibly easy to get away with because there’s no repercussions for the ghoster. Anna Sale, host and managing editor of the WNYC podcast ‘Death, Sex & Money,’ believes that social media and technology assist in the avoidance of difficult conversations. More than that, our phones have become our own personal firewall against complex, real life relationships.', '“People don’t hold themselves accountable anymore because they can hide behind their phones.” — Justine Bylo', 'There are many reasons people ghost each other. Often it’s because the ghoster would rather avoid any confrontation, for fear that telling the truth will hurt the other person’s feelings. Duh! This avoidance tactic allows someone to dodge the responsibility of having to explain, in an uncomfortable conversation, that they’re just not that into you. I’ve confronted friends I know who participate in ghosting to better understand why they do it, and I’ve been given similar responses. A young Frenchman I know explained that he will ghost a girl if she is being pushy, needy, or if he is too distracted (with his social life or work) to deal with her. He also admitted to being somewhat lazy with his replies.', '“If you disappear completely, you never have to deal with knowing someone is mad at you and being the bad guy,” — Jenny Mollen', 'I’ve also read comments online from ghosters who believe that no communication at all will make the problem go away, but of course it never does. Some ghosters have reported “being confused with their feelings” and need time to work things out. Then why not just tell the person? “I need some time to work this out.” The internet is riddled with theories concerning ghosting. I’ve even read that the ambiguous nature of ghosting could be viewed as an indecisive action, so to leave possibilities open for future connections. But I’m not really sold on this — considering ghosting is the act of completely ignoring someone. So why would you then want to reconnect with that person?', 'This all depends on the ghosted. If you have a strong sense of character and a healthy self-esteem, then you’re going to be more resilient to this kind of behavior. But the emotional effects can be devastating for someone with lower self-esteem — particularly if you’re someone who is sensitive and have developed feelings for that person. But no matter who you are — ghosting hurts because there’s no sense of closure. When most relationships nosedive, they usually end with a painful moral lesson — a blessing in disguise, a gift wrapped turd (not like Shitexpress, yes you can actually send a piece of shit to someone … please don’t). When my ex broke up with me in my twenties, she met me for coffee, we talked, held hands and cried. We both came to an acceptance that we had outgrown each other and handled the separation in a mature, compassionate way. But when you leave someone hanging without closure, then there is no life lesson. There is no closure.', 'Ghosting is also painful because it is usually someone you have made an emotional or meaningful connection with (at least you thought so at the time) or someone that you believe cares about you. It’s no wonder their sudden indifference can leave you feeling confused, depressed and hurt. In truth, it can leave you emotionally drained. What remains is a hole — an insecurity where there should be an answer. You are left questioning yourself: What did I do wrong? Did I offend them? Was it something I said? Was it my appearance? Are they OK? All these worries and self-doubt can start to circle until you are in a desperate state of anxiety. On top of that, it is believed that social rejection activates pathways to the brain that correlate with physical pain. So it’s not surprising that the disregarded can have such conflicting emotional reactions. I know people who have even suffered post-ghosting depression after dating someone who spontaneously disappeared.', '“Communication represents an essential and very important human need as well as a basic human right. The right to communication should be considered in the framework of freedom of expression.” — Sen A. Fulya', 'Modern relationships are challenging to navigate at the best of times. But as human beings, I believe we have an obligation to communicate as honestly as possible with people. It certainly isn’t always easy to scoop up the courage to tell someone the cold hard truth, especially if you’ve been burned in the past. But as Gloria Steinem once said: “The truth will set you free, but first it will piss you off.” So whatever your fears with communication are, you have a choice in how to respond. But respond you must. Because no matter how you try and spin it, ghosting is downright disrespectful. We are social beings and communication is an essential human need. When you deny someone of that, you are denying them their dignity and their right to be heard. Like Paul Colaianni, from his wonderful podcast, ‘The Overwhelmed Brain’ says: “You have the choice to show up as your authentic self.”']

Right before we sold we had just reached $2 million in monthly revenue and we were netting roughly 40% of that in profit. At the point of sale we had not raised any capital and my ownership of the company sat around 34%.', 'The following list is comprised of lessons I learned while building and growing a successful multimillion dollar enterprise. My hope is that by sharing this brief list I can add value and save time for others in their various pursuits.', '1.Avoid VC Money at all Costs — When I used to work in software, I can’t tell you how many entrepreneur friends I had who used the amount of money they raised as a badge of success. Avoid this type of false logic. The only metric you should care about when building a business is whether it is profitable. As the VC bubble bursts and funds dry up, the long term winners will be the slow and steady value businesses with strong fundamentals. Hearing about how someone raised $50 million may sound appealing, but the real question you should be asking is why they needed to raise $50 million in the first place and how much equity they have left over. The bootstrapping philosophy of entrepreneurship may not be enticing, but it’s certainly lucrative.', '2.Diversity is Key — It seems like a cliche, but entrepreneurs still frequently make this mistake. Diversity offers up fresh ideas and directions that could have been overlooked. If you’re in a situation where everyone in your office is male, younger than 25 and graduated from top universities you could be making a mistake.', '3.Your money’s value depreciates the older you become — When you’re in your early 20’s the capital you produce is more valuable than at any other point in your lifetime. Understanding compounding interest is absolutely essential to build serious value over the long term. The scenario below illustrates compounding interest and the difference between saving/investing when you’re young compared to when you’re older:', '$10,000.00 invested at 20 with standard 7% annual growth = $579,464.27 by the time you’re 80.', '$10,000.00 invested at 40 with standard 7% annual growth = $149,744.58 by the time you’re 80.', 'Respect your money and the power it has while you’re young. If there’s any truth to people taking risks at a young age, the validity can be supported from compounding interest. Succeeding and investing young is helpful if you want to build substantial wealth.', 'You can see for yourself by using this compounding interest calculator.', '4.Think With Abundance in Mind, but apply Discipline — Never hoard your resources and or think with a mindset of scarcity. This thought process will only limit your ability to grow your business. Simultaneously, be disciplined with your financial resources. The essence of this concept in practice is simple: invest your personal funds and your company’s into your business and don’t leave too much room for yourself.', '5.Kill your Ego, before it kills you — In any business, your ego and the egos of your partners can become a challenge, especially when growth occurs. Overcoming this very subtle but potent problem is essential before it metastasizes throughout everyday business interactions. As you begin to achieve success, managing and remaining humble becomes absolutely paramount. I’ve seen countless entrepreneurs get a big head too soon only to get slammed back down by reality. Remember your roots, the universe will reward you.', '6.Marketing is your protein, but sales is the work out — Too many startups nowadays overemphasize marketing and branding and underemphasize their sales efforts. Though telling a captivating story and having a ubiquitous brand is essential, it should not be your only focus. My partners and I always followed the analogy that marketing is analogous to protein, it’s a supplement that will help your company perform, but without the work out component, which is sales, your company will just get fat.', 'I think much of the recent emphasis on marketing is derived from the belief that building an online business is easier than building a real one. This isn’t necessarily the case as of recent. Despite the growth of e-commerce, 85% of sales transactions still occur in retail channels. To neglect physical retail is to limit yourself to 15% of the consumer market. Invest in real sales people.', '7.Spend Time in Nature — Similar to business nature is a chaotic, unpredictable and paradoxically organized system. Going outdoors and placing yourself in unpredictable environments for a few days can encourage more adaptive thinking. In post industrial society, adaptive thinking is adversely impacted by quotidian routines. Spending time outdoors can broaden your perspective and help you view business decisions more acutely than when inside the metaphorical trenches of day to day business operations.', 'For thousands of years people have looked up at starry night skies to get a sense of direction and perspective. More than ever, I think it can be beneficial to take our eyes away from our LED lit microcosms of the digital world to peer up at the macrocosm that is our universe.', '8.Read — It’s another cliche, but it’s true. Read as much as you can. Reading improves your syntax, communication and ability to recall. When I was in high school I would spend my summers devouring literary content. I averaged a book a day at one point. Don’t do yourself a disservice and limit yourself to nonfiction either. Consume a diverse pallet of ideas and concepts. They will prove useful. Similar to capital, knowledge is compounding. The sooner you can expand your knowledge base, the sooner you can outcompete others and better identify opportunities when they arise.', '9.Consistency is Key — I used to run Track and Field. One lesson I derived from my experience doing so is that when you feel you are at your most exhausted, most lethargic point is precisely when you should speed up and start sprinting. The reason for this is because others are just as exhausted as you are. Don’t take your foot off the accelerator, eventually the universe will give in your favor.', '10.Embrace Emotions — It’s essential to talk about how you feel with your business partners. Negating your emotions will only resolve in them emerging through other passive aggressive means. This can be harmful to your business. Being open and transparent about your feelings whether they pertain to jealousy, anger and or frustration will help you squash any animosity you have so that you can focus on growing the business. When something feels off, address those specific feelings and the potential roots of those feelings with your partners.', '11.When you start out, your business should be the most important thing — A mentor of mine once told me that the key to building a business rapidly is to treat it like a religious experience. Meaning that all material, emotional and or personal possessions you may have should take a secondary role in your life. Your primary focal point in life needs to be the business in its incipient phases. Once the business blossoms you can pull back, but before that your focus and priorities need to be the business.', 'I spent a year sleeping on my co-founder’s couch and then another year sleeping in my second office’s conference room. To this day it was probably the most challenging, but interesting period of my life. Nothing fosters a more powerful meditative state than eliminating everything and building something from the ground up.', '12.Run your business, don’t let your business run you — This may seem paradoxical given the aforementioned statement, but too many entrepreneurs have a habit of overworking to a point where it can adversely impact their venture. Initially, working hard will accelerate your business’s growth, but eventually you need to evolve from a startup entrepreneur to a business manager. Once your business is profitable, learning to delegate tasks to others and not allowing yourself to be bogged down by details will help you maintain a clear and dynamic perspective. Individuals who fail to do this are at risk of stagnating their business’s growth or being outgrown by their business.', '13.Know when to fight the current and know when to go downstream — A company’s continued success can in many ways be analogous to sailing a ship. As a leader in your company you want to interpret the motions of an industry, and ultimately, adjust the sails and let the current guide you. I’ve seen countless entrepreneurs be demolished in changing industries, because they failed to adapt with new evolutions in their ecosystems.', 'There’s an old adage, which I think can be valuable to consider when dealing with any venture, “Change isn’t good or bad, it just is.” The lesson to be learned here is don’t be stubborn and or let preconceived biases affect your judgement.', '14.Beware of Service Businesses — Nowadays service businesses are all the craze. Whether it be starting an agency and or a software platform that provides an existing service, people seem to think services are easier than products. Service businesses may require lower costs to start, but that also means a lower barrier to entry, which results in heightened competition. The other issue with a service sector company is that its success solely depends on the time you dedicate to it. As a result, service sector companies don’t produce capital for you while you sleep.', 'Since the venetian times those who were involved in the exchange of goods generated the most capital. To this day, offering up goods that others need will always be an easier path once the wheels get turning.', '15.Fail and adapt or move on — I can’t even count how many skeletons there are of dead startups I have spent years working on. It’s important to get an idea off the ground and put it out into the market, but if the market doesn’t respond to it, adapt or move on. I know countless entrepreneurs who spent 10+ years on a company that simply wasn’t working. The Sunk Cost Theory is very real and very dangerous.', '16.Don’t let your company waste time on politics — company politics slow down progress. It’s good to brainstorm, but at a certain point you have to start making decisions. A good rule of thumb is to ban meetings once a week. We decided to ban company meetings on Wednesdays. It did wonders for us.', '17.Avoid Personal Debt like the plague — Pretty simple, debt is deadly and will hold you back. Try to avoid it at all costs. After graduating from college I had $105,000 in student loans at 8% interest. My monthly payments at one point exceeded $1,200. It was brutal. That being said, there are scenarios when debt can be valuable, just make sure the interest rate is low, the risk is weighted and the debt is being used to generate cashflow.', '18.Strategic Incentives — When managing a business there are two mechanisms to drive company performance: revenue and profit. Typically, your sales and marketing divisions are focused on leveraging company cash flow to increase revenue. Simultaneously, warehouse, administrative and operations staff should be focused on finding ways to increase profit by cutting costs. Though these seem like contrasting strategies, together they can create a potent formula for financial success.', 'One common mistake made by entrepreneurs is to offer up commission based incentives for sales divisions and not offer up similar incentives for operations and administrative staff. In my businesses I always try to offer up incentives to operations and administrative staff in the form of “savings” commissions. For example, if you have a bookkeeper who manages your financials, offer them a 30% commission on all funds they save the business. This incentive will motivate them to negotiate with vendors and be more scrupulous of accounts payables. These types of incentives across your entire business will help maintain a lean enterprise with high profitability.', '19.Don’t Micromanage — Give your people breathing room to operate. Don’t tell people what to do and or try to grind them out. It will only create a toxic environment. Trust me, you won’t enjoy it either.', '20.It’s not about money — Obviously the financial gain of successful entrepreneurship is enticing, however that shouldn’t be your primary motivator. Innovating within an industry will always yield fruit and is a far more enticing self motivator over the long term. If money is why you’re pursuing entrepreneurship then you’d fair far better in investment banking and or consulting.', '21.Always act like you have less than you do — Successful entrepreneurship is methodical and requires discipline to guarantee long term success. It’s easy to make money, it’s hard to retain and build it. If you’re spending patterns grow and or match your financial success you’ll get knocked back down to where you started when you face a downturn. As an entrepreneur you have to accept that you live in a world of peaks and valleys. As a result, your emotional and financial wavelength will oscillate far more aggressively. The safest solution is to minimize expenditure to guarantee that you can sustain any kind of deep valley. I have always been wary of high flying entrepreneurs who are loud and or who possess too many nice things. It shows where their priorities lie.', 'I’ve learned this lesson from first hand experience. By the time I was a senior in high school I had turned a $2,500.00 E-Trade account, which I started at 14, into a portfolio well north of $100,000.00 by 18 from investing in Macau casinos and tracking Corn indexes relative to ethanol demand. I began spending money aggressively around that time and by the end of my freshman year in College, I got cleaned out from one call options play on a trucking security. It took me a few years to recover from that mistake, I could have recovered faster had I been smarter with my capital.', 'To this day, I now only spend a tenth of what I make on a monthly basis.', '22.It’s about the people stupid — Ultimately, amid the clutter and the rapturous environment of any startup are the people. They are the company and the company is them. Take care of your people, they are your greatest asset. At the company I sold, my partners and I gave every employee $1,000.00 for exclusively vacation purposes. We did this to force them to go on vacation. The money we spent was definitely returned to us via higher productivity.', '23.Distill Complex Problems — In building a business you’re often faced with complex problems with unclear solutions. A valuable mental exercise is to focus and obsess on areas of “friction” in your business until they become “smoothed” out.', 'Many people will avoid aspects of their business that they find unattractive and or difficult. If there’s an aspect of your business that you find uncomfortable and or unappealing, focus on it. By focusing on the weaknesses of your business you will be able to find unique solutions that will strengthen your business’s core.', 'Distill your business into areas of strength and weakness and then aggressively attack the areas of weakness.', '24.Have a Compass — It’s important to have a long term vision for your company and where you want it to go. This vision can adapt and evolve overtime as circumstances change, but maintaining a clear and grandiose vision is critical. Ensure that the rest of the company understands this vision as well. Nothing is more powerful than the combined energy of people with a shared vision. History is a testament to this.', '25.Enjoy The Ride — If there’s one regret in the last few years, it was not taking enough moments to observe and appreciate my own experience and the growth we achieved.', 'What is success truly worth if you don’t share it with others?', 'It may be a cliche, but ultimately the satisfaction derived from shared experiences, risks, relationships and memories will always supersede any dollar you make.', 'The path of entrepreneurship can be a lonely road for anyone who treads down it. It will become difficult to relate to others as the ineffable aspects of your daily routine diverge from most people around you. It is during these times that having people to confide in becomes crucial.', 'In the end, family and friends are your most valuable asset…', 'If you’ve read this far I appreciate your time and I hope I haven’t sounded preachy. I’m an avid opponent of dogmatic thinking and would hate for this to come off as contrived.', 'My hope is that by sharing my experiences others could find some benefit in their respective journeys as well. Ultimately, there is no correct path, methodology and or silver bullet to building a successful business. At a certain point you simply have to take off your life jacket, jump into the abyss and learn to swim.', 'Solace Technologies was sold for $15.25 million in cash and stock with an additional cash sweep of approximately $1.25 million. The total deal value was approximately $16.5 million when we sold to Turning Point Brands (NYSE: TPB) in 2019. We sold the company so that we could spearhead Turning Point Brand’s Nu-X ventures division and create a product engine accelerator for their business.', 'Outside of the sale of my company I made most of my capital from investing in publicly traded securities as well as from my Accelerator / Agency DPGW.', 'Favorite Books: The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Old Man and the Sea, The Elegant Universe, The Intelligent Investor, Mass vs. Minorities, A Brief History of Time, The Corrections, Norwegian Wood, Beating the Street, Fountainhead, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, 1Q84, White Noise, Rendezvous with Rama, Good To Great, Animal Farm, Blue Ocean Strategy, Lean Startup Principle, Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love, Meditations.']
08/2019	6 Reasons Why Yahoo! Failed	-	253	0	https://medium.com/@ssaurel	https://medium.com/swlh/6-reasons-why-yahoo-failed-6004d67e86ff?source=collection_archive---------9-----------------------	11	8	['6 Reasons Why Yahoo! Failed', 'Yahoo! Has Never Had A Real Vision', 'A Monumental Casting Error For Its CEO In 2001', 'Acquisitions At A Golden Price For Nothing', 'Great Missed Opportunities', 'Rejection Of Various Microsoft Acquisition Offers', 'The Final Blow With The Appointment Of Marissa Mayer As CEO', 'Conclusion']	42	['Founded in 1994 by Jerry Yang and David Filo, Yahoo! was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s. The company has grown rapidly to become a full-featured Web portal with a host of services covering most user needs with the search engine Yahoo! Search around which was grafted Yahoo! Directory, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! News or Yahoo! Finance to name just a few of the many services offered by Yahoo!.', 'In the early 2000s, just before the dot-com bubble burst, Yahoo! was the most visited site in the world. During the 2000s, Yahoo! accumulated the wrong choices and eventually lost all its value. Yahoo! activities was even divided into two parts in 2017. Thus, Verizon acquired Yahoo!’s Internet division for $4.48 billion while the shares in Alibaba and Yahoo! Japan were held in the newly created company Altaba.', 'It is 2019 and even if Yahoo! remains in the Top 10 of the most visited sites in the world, it is hard to see how the company could regain its former glory. It even seems to be condemned to vegetate like this now. All this led me to come back to the 6 reasons that explain, in my opinion, why Yahoo! failed when the company had many assets to succeed and be part of the GAFAM club.', 'When Jerry Yang and David Filo conceived in January 1994 what would later become Yahoo!, they were still only students at Stanford. All this strangely reminiscent of the story of Google’s creation a few years later in Stanford by students Larry Page and Sergey Brin.', 'In 1994, the general public Internet was still in its infancy and although the number of websites was still relatively limited, it was difficult to find websites on specific interests’ fields. Thus, Jerry Yang and David Filo’s idea is therefore to propose a directory organized in a hierarchical way of websites. Initially called “Jerry and David’s guide to the World Wide Web”, this directory was later renamed Yahoo! in March 1994.', 'The idea of hierarchical organization of websites within a directory is therefore the opposite of a search engine that would index the different web pages with a crawler. Taking full advantage of the first mover advantage, Yahoo! nevertheless quickly established itself at its launch as a must and became a complete Web portal offering many other services.', 'Following its launch to the general public in 1996, Yahoo! is a direct competitor of the industry leaders Lycos, Excite and America Online. The success is such that the share price increases by 600% in the first two years!', 'All this is fine, but deep down, Yahoo! has no real vision of what its future should be. This Achilles’ heel remains well hidden at that time, however, since in 1998, Yahoo is the most popular starting point for web users. In addition, Yahoo! Directory is the most popular search engine with 95 million page views per day, three times more than its main rival Excite.', 'Nevertheless, Yahoo! Directory is a directory published by humans which represents a colossal work. Yahoo! therefore also offers a search engine based on indexing technology but does not finance the development of its own search engine, which is a big mistake in retrospect. Even bigger is the mistake made by the leaders of Yahoo! at this time to refuse the acquisition of PageRank technology at the heart of Google when Sergey Brin and Larry Page came to see them in 1998.', 'Finally, Yahoo! began using Google’s services for its search engine in 2000, which allowed Google to gain notoriety and developing itself faster. At the same time, Yahoo! confirms its lack of vision for its future by multiplying acquisitions in all directions without taking the time to develop its acquisitions.', 'The lack of vision of Yahoo!’s executives reached its peak when they refused to buy Google in 2002 for $3 billion, considering this amount overvalued…. It should be recalled that they had acquired Geocities and Broadcast.com in 1999 for $3.6 billion and $5.7 billion respectively!', 'It is always this same lack of vision that will then cost Yahoo! opportunities such as the advent of social networks or the switch to mobile-first.', 'At the top of the dot-com bubble, Yahoo!’s stock reached a record high of $118.75 on January 3, 2000. After the dot-com bubble burst, the Yahoo! share reached a low of $8.11 on September 26, 2001.', 'Nevertheless, Yahoo! remains strong as it is one of the most visited sites in the world. Of course, Google is starting to develop itself with its innovative search engine technology but it is not yet the giant we know today. In order to further its development and relaunch itself after the dot-com bubble burst, Yahoo! decided to hire a new CEO in 2001.', 'At the same time, Google also decides to hire a CEO to help the search engine move up a gear. This choice made in the same year by both companies will have a monumental impact on their future.', 'On the one hand, Google chooses to appoint Eric Schmidt to this position. From Novell, he is no stranger to new technologies, having spent most of his career at Sun Microsystems, where he made a significant contribution to the development and dissemination of the Java programming language. To put it simply, Eric Schmidt is clearly a man of the new economy, the Internet economy, who will take power in the 2000s.', 'On the other hand, Yahoo! chose to appoint a certain Terry Semel as CEO. He has a stronger background behind him, having held positions of great responsibility at the mastodon Warner Bros. to the point of becoming CEO in the mid-1990s. However, unlike Eric Schmidt, he does not know the new world of the Internet. For many, he is a man of the old world.', 'And this is another major mistake in Yahoo’s history: under his leadership, Yahoo! will multiply the strategic mistakes while under Eric Schmidt’s leadership, Google will multiply the paying choices.', 'The GAFAM have become as powerful by making a very large number of acquisitions over the course of their history. All these acquisitions do not prove to be successes, but in the whole, there are always some that prove to be a great success. A pioneer among Web giants, Yahoo! has not escaped this trend and has also made many acquisitions in its history.', 'This is quite natural. However, what is less so is the incredible number of acquisitions made at a golden price by Yahoo! that have resulted in monumental failures.', 'It all started in 1999 when Yahoo! bought the Broadcast.com streaming platform from Mark Cuban for $5.7 billion! Of course, we were in the middle of the dot-com bubble, but still, this amount seems quite incredible. In the end, this acquisition will have resulted in nothing but making Mark Cuban ultra wealthy and allowing him to become one of the most famous NBA owners with his Dallas Mavericks franchise.', 'Still driven by the excitement of this period of the dot-com bubble, Yahoo! also bought GeoCities in 1999 for $3.6 billion. GeoCities was an ultra-popular solution that allowed users to easily create web pages. Yahoo! could have tried to develop GeoCities but once again, it lets the service die little by little.', 'In 2002, Terry Semel refused to acquire Google for between $2 billion and $3 billion. The amount seemed too high at the time and Yahoo! was still being burnt out by its failed acquisitions with Broadcast.com and GeoCities. This was again a monumental mistake as it often was with Yahoo! unfortunately.', 'A year later, when Yahoo! realized that Google was eating its market share in the search world, the company tried to catch up by acquiring Overture, a company that was developing a search engine for $1.63 billion. This movement was too late and was a complete waste. We all know the rest: Google has largely won the battle of search engines.', 'Aware that it was missing out on the wave of social networks in the second half of the 2000s, Yahoo! will once again acquire startups in all directions without successfully integrating them into its ecosystem. The acquisitions of Flickr, Delicious and Right Media are to be classified in this category. It should be remembered that the acquisition of Right Media was completed in 2007 for $850 million and that Yahoo! never really managed to take its share of the cake in the social networks world.', 'These few examples are unfortunately far from representing an exhaustive list of Yahoo!’s mistakes in company acquisitions. The latest example to date: the Tumblr blogging platform. Purchased for $1.1 billion by Yahoo! in 2013, Tumblr has continued to lose users under the leadership of Yahoo! and has just been sold in 2019 by Verizon to Automaticc, the publisher of WordPress.com, for an amount of approximately $10 million, more than 100 times less than when Yahoo! acquired it in 2013!', 'Throughout its history, Yahoo! has therefore made many acquisitions at golden price that have resulted in nothing. To this problem is also added the bad tendency of Yahoo! to miss great opportunities that could have changed his future.', 'In 1998, Yahoo! is being offered by Larry Page and Sergey Brin the opportunity to purchase their revolutionary search engine algorithm for the derisory amount (today) of $1 million. Widely leader in the field of search engines with its hierarchy directory, Yahoo! do not see the value of buying this algorithm and lets pass a first opportunity to get their hands on what has made Google what it is today.', 'In 2002, while Yahoo! helped Google grow and gain notoriety by using its search engine technology for its Internet search engine, Terry Semel is trying to acquire Google from the founders. He is ready to put $1 billion on the table. Larry Page and Sergey Brin finally ask for $3 billion and specify that they don’t want to sale Google for putting pressure on Terry Semel, the CEO of Yahoo!. The latter ultimately considers this amount too expensive and prefers to give up this acquisition of Google that would have totally changed the future of Yahoo!', 'In 2006, Google has already become a leader in the world of online research. Now, the new trend in vogue is that of social networks. Again, Yahoo! did not see coming rise of this new trend. Nevertheless, the company has the opportunity this year 2006 to get their hands on Facebook to catch up. Mark Zuckerberg is asking for $1 billion for the sale of his technological nugget. Yahoo! judge this price over-estimated and prefers to make acquisitions at a lower price with Delicious or Flickr for example.', 'Again, it’s a huge mistake on Terry Semel’s part. These 3 major missed opportunities would have clearly enabled Yahoo! to be totally different today. Nevertheless, to achieve them, it would have been necessary to have a CEO a little visionary what was clearly not the case.', 'Aware of Google’s rise to power, Microsoft and Yahoo! have discussed an acquisition opportunity several times in 2005, 2006 and 2007. While analysts seem sceptical about the combination of these companies’ technologies, Microsoft continues to be interested in Yahoo! and finally proposes $44.6 billion in early 2008 to buy all of Yahoo!', 'Back at the head of Yahoo! following Terry Semel’s departure, Jerry Yang is clearly opposed to such an acquisition and points out that it does not represent a fair price for Yahoo! After months of dithering and a new offer from Microsoft to simply acquire Yahoo! search engine division, the deal is not done what makes the Yahoo! stock price plunge for good.', 'This new missed opportunity becomes even more surprising when in 2009, Jerry Yang’s successor enters into a 10-year agreement with Microsoft to give Steve Ballmer’s company full access to its search engine technology to help Microsoft develop its internal search engine Bing.', 'It’s clearly not to be understood and it still illustrates the many management errors at the head of Yahoo! that have led the company to where it is today.', 'In the middle of 2012, Yahoo! is trying to revive again by naming Marissa Mayer who made a successful career at Google. This appointment as CEO of Marissa Mayer gives rise to a lot of hope. Incidentally, Marissa Mayer becomes the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company.', 'Marissa Mayer’s first few months are pretty good and she stands out with the acquisition of the Tumblr blogging platform for $1.1 billion in May 2013. This acquisition is welcomed by analysts and the hope that Yahoo! will return to the top becomes real in late summer 2013 when we learn that all Yahoo! sites have experienced more visits than Google sites in July 2013.', 'Unfortunately, this lull will be short-lived. The following months were disastrous. Yahoo! can’t develop Tumblr correctly, it’s slowly losing ground even if it remains popular with its fans from the beginning. The other acquisitions made by Yahoo! during the Marissa Mayer era most of the time turn into chess.', 'At the end of 2016, Yahoo! revealed that a hacking of its platform compromised more than 500 million user accounts in 2014. Worse still, we learn a few weeks later that another security breach has increased the total number of compromised user accounts to 1 billion. This is the biggest flaw in the history of the Internet that a Web giant has ever experienced.', 'All this is finishing up Yahoo! which continues to fall inexorably even though its portal remains popular with Internet users. In 2017, Yahoo! was finally bought by Verizon for “only” $4.48 billion. A paltry amount when you think of what Yahoo! was worth in the mid-2000s. Yahoo!’s shares in Alibaba and Yahoo! Japan’s activities are not part of the deal and remain in a separate company called Altaba.', 'In the end, Marissa Mayer’s move to head Yahoo! was the final blow for one of the pioneers of the Web.', 'Today, Yahoo! remains an extremely popular portal as it is one of the Top 10 most visited sites in the world. Nevertheless, its 8th place does not augur well for a bright future and everything suggests that Yahoo! will continue to die gradually in the coming years to finally remain as one of the biggest waste in the history of the Web.']

The next Halving will be Bitcoin’s third and will take place in May 2020. This is when the current block reward of 12.5 Bitcoin every 10 minutes will be cut in half to 6.25 Bitcoin.', 'Seeing as the maximum supply cap for Bitcoin is 21 million, halving the block reward means that it will take longer for all Bitcoin to enter circulation.', 'But this also means that less and less new Bitcoin will be created over time and due to its limited supply — Bitcoin will continue to become increasingly scarce.', 'And scarcity enhances value.', 'Historically, the Bitcoin Halving has proven to be an important catalyst that propels Bitcoin into a new Bull Market.', 'In fact, Bitcoin tends to begin its new bull trend at least a year before its Halving.', 'But what effect does the Bitcoin Halving have on Bitcoin’s price?', 'In this article, I will address the following questions:', 'The first ever Bitcoin Halving took place at the end of November 2012.', 'It took approximately 513 days for Bitcoin to rally over 13,000% from the $2.01 bottom to the Market Cycle top of $270.94.', 'Bitcoin’s first Halving was a key catalyst that spurred significant growth and a new bull cycle for Bitcoin.', 'As soon as Bitcoin reached its post-Halving peak of $270.94, the 2013 Bear Market began as Bitcoin’s price declined 80%. This Bear Market lasted approximately 87 days.', 'The second Bitcoin Halving took place in early July 2016.', 'It took 1068 days for Bitcoin to rally over 12,000% from the $164.01 bottom to the Market Cycle top of $20,074.', 'After the $20,074 peak — Bitcoin entered a 51 week bear market that bottomed in mid-December 2018.', 'Historically, the Bitcoin Halving has been a key catalyst in propelling Bitcoin into a new bull market.', 'Bitcoin’s price appreciates both leading up to the Halving as well as many months after the Halving has taken place.', 'In fact, Bitcoin has reached a new All-Time High as a result of the Halving.', 'But it is many months after the Halving that this new All-Time High in Bitcoin’s price is set.', 'There are similarities in Bitcoin’s price growth across both Halvings.', 'Let’s first consider Halving #1.', 'It took Bitcoin 513 days to rally as much as 13,304% from its pre-Halving bottom of $2.01 to its post-Halving top of $270.94.', 'Now let’s look at Halving #2.', 'It took Bitcoin 1068 days to rally as much as 12,168% from its pre-Halving bottom of $164.01 to its post-Halving top of $20,074.04.', 'The similarity across both Halvings is that Bitcoin rallied approximately 12,000–13,000% from the bottom of the pre-Halving bear market to the top of the post-Halving bull market.', 'But a crucial difference is that it took Bitcoin twice as long to experience that similar growth around the second Halving period (1067 days compared to the 513 days around Halving #1).', 'How do these insights compare to what we already know about Bitcoin’s upcoming third Halving?', 'The third Bitcoin Halving is estimated to take place on the 17th of May 2020.', 'As of this writing, it has taken Bitcoin over 260 days to rally over 340% since its $3,152 bottom set back in mid-December 2018.', 'This means that Bitcoin’s price bottomed approximately 519 days before Bitcoin’s third Halving.', 'This is very interesting because there are some key similarities in comparison to Bitcoin’s second Halving.', 'Here are the figures in question for Bitcoin’s second Halving:', 'At this moment in time, Bitcoin’s pre-Halving #3 price action very closely resembles Bitcoin’s pre-Halving #2 price action.', 'This is a powerful recurring theme so let’s break down Bitcoin’s price in relation to its Halvings further.', 'Let’s divide Bitcoin’s price into “Pre-Halving” and “Post-Halving” periods in an effort to spot any further recurring tendencies or themes that could inform our understanding about the upcoming third Bitcoin Halving.', 'Most of the exponential growth in Bitcoin’s price as a result of the Halving occurs after the Halving.', 'Leading up to Bitcoin’s first Halving, Bitcoin rallied 663% to reach the pre-Halving top of $15.51.', 'Once Bitcoin bottomed after its -50% pre-Halving retrace, Bitcoin rallied over 3400% post-Halving to reach its Market Cycle top of $270.94.', 'Leading up to Bitcoin’s second Halving, Bitcoin rallied 383% to reach the pre-Halving top of $794.91.', 'Bitcoin rallied 4080% in 524 days to reach the Market Cycle top of $20,074.', 'To summarise:', 'Clearly, most of the exponential growth in Bitcoin’s price as a result of the Halving has occurred after the Halving.', 'In fact, Bitcoin has managed to set a new All-Time High in price after each of the previous Halvings.', 'After reaching a new All-Time High, Bitcoin would top out to end the bull market and subsequently enter a bear market period that would see Bitcoin retrace at least -80%.', 'Bitcoin experienced stronger and quicker growth prior to Halving #1 compared to the growth prior to Halving #2.', 'Prior to the first Halving, Bitcoin rallied almost twice as much (663%) to reach the pre-Halving top compared to Bitcoin’s 383% price rally to reach the pre-Halving top prior to the second Halving.', 'In fact, it took Bitcoin almost half the time to do so.', 'To summarise:', 'If Bitcoin rallies less pre-Halving, then it will rally more post-Halving.', 'Prior to the first Halving, Bitcoin rallied 663% to reach its pre-Halving#1 top but later rallied 3,400% after the Halving.', 'Prior to the second Halving, Bitcoin rallied 383% to reach its pre-Halving #2 top but later rallied 4,080% after the Halving.', 'There has always been a pre-Halving retrace (i.e. “shake-out”).', 'This pre-Halving retrace has been a Bear Trap for many investors in the past.', 'Many investors would sell their Bitcoin to book their profits whereas others would sell in fear of a strong downtrend and get shaken out of their investments.', 'In any case, both types of investors would miss out on the future exponential uptrends.', 'Simply knowing about this tendency could potentially help investors avoid such a fate leading up to Bitcoin’s third Halving, should history indeed repeat itself by presenting such a retrace yet again.', 'Which is why it may be useful to further dissect these retraces and compare them to one another in order to aid our understanding.', 'Let’s first look at the retrace prior to Halving #1.', 'The pre-Halving retrace prior to Halving #1:', 'a) Occurred over 100 days before the Halving, b) Was -50% deep,c) Lasted only 2 days.', 'But this was enough to shakeout a fair amount of investors out of their Bitcoin positions (even though Bitcoin had recovered almost the entirety of whatever valuation it had briefly lost on said retrace by the day of the Halving #1).', 'Once Bitcoin bottomed after its -50% pre-Halving retrace, Bitcoin rallied over 3400% post-Halving to reach its Market Cycle top of $270.94.', 'Let’s now consider the retrace prior to Halving #2.', 'It took Bitcoin 521 days to rally 383% from its bottom to its pre-Halving local top of $794.91 before the “shake-out” retrace (interestingly, it took Bitcoin a similar amount of days — approximately 524 days — to reach the $20,000 top)', 'This pre-Halving #2 retrace was quite different to retrace prior to Halving #1 as it:', 'a) Occurred 24 days before Halving #2, b) Was -38% deep,c) Lasted 44 days,d) Continued for 20 days AFTER the Halving.', 'The fact that the retrace lasted 44 days meant that it continued past Halving #2.', 'So Bitcoin’s price leading into the first Halving was uptrending, whereas Bitcoin’s price leading into the second Halving was downtrending.', 'To summarise:', 'Though there aren’t any outstanding commonalities among these retraces, it is still important to know about their specifics, even if it is just to manage expectations as to what is possible in the retrace leading up to Bitcoin third Halving.', 'The pre-Halving top prior to the “shake-out” retrace has historically been Bitcoin’s highest pre-Halving price point, but wasn’t high enough to set a new All-Time High', 'Leading into the Halving, there tends to be an acceleratory run-up in Bitcoin’s price before the “shake-out” retrace occurs.', 'Since its bottom in the previous bear market, this happens to be Bitcoin’s highest price point before the actual Halving.', 'However, this price point doesn’t eclipse the previous All-Time High.', 'In fact, this price point is approximately -33% (i.e. Halving #2) to -51% (i.e. Halving #1) below the old Bitcoin All-Time High from the previous Market Cycle.', 'A new All-Time High in Bitcoin’s price has always occurred many months after the Halving.', 'By now, we have spotted many different compelling tendencies in Bitcoin’s price action as a result of Bitcoin’s Halving.', 'At this stage, the question is whether we can use this information to deduce the effect that the upcoming third Bitcoin Halving could potentially have on Bitcoin’s price.', 'People tend to use historical market data to deduce trends and extrapolate that data into potential future trends.', 'Though historical price action can be useful in predicting future trends, no future price action will ever emulate historical data completely.', 'Based on Bitcoin’s historical tendencies prior to and after its Halvings, one can only speculate on how Bitcoin’s price could potentially behave as a result of its upcoming third Halving.', 'Having said that, let’s take the most important tendencies and examine them through the lens of historical price data in regards to Bitcoin’s future price behaviour leading up to the third Halving.', 'The first Bitcoin Halving spurred 13,378% growth in Bitcoin’s price whereas the second Bitcoin Halving spurred a 12,160% rally.', 'A 12,160% rally from Bitcoin’s mid-December 2018 bear market bottom of $3,150 would result in a ~$385,000 Bitcoin.', 'By the same token a 13,378% rally would lead to a ~$425,000 Bitcoin.', 'A $385,000 Bitcoin is very interesting because that would mean that Bitcoin’s Market Cap (i.e. $189 billion as of this writing) will have eclipsed the current Market Cap of Gold (i.e. $7.8 trillion).', 'This occurrence would truly cement Bitcoin’s status as a “Digital Gold.”', 'Since mid-December 2018, Bitcoin rallied over 340% which closely resembles the 383% rally that Bitcoin experienced leading up to its second Halving.', 'If Bitcoin were to rally 383% like it did prior to Halving #2, it would reach a new Market Cycle high of ~$15,000 which is higher than the current Market Cycle local top of $13,900 as of this writing.', 'This turn of events would satisfy the historical tendencies of setting a new Market Cycle prior to the Halving but not a new All-Time High.', 'This in turn would also satisfy another key tendency: if Bitcoin rallies less pre-Halving, it will rally more post-Halving (and for a longer period of time).', 'Should this tendency play out once again, this would mean that Bitcoin would have a higher likelihood of rallying over 13,000% compared to the 12,000% rally from Halving #2.', 'On the other hand however, if Bitcoin were to rally similarly to its 663% uptrend prior to Halving #1, that would mean that Bitcoin would reach a price point of almost $24,000 prior to Halving #3.', 'Of course, this would lead to a new All-Time High prior to the third Halving which is something that goes against the aforementioned historical tendency.', 'It is for this reason that Bitcoin’s price action may continue to closely resemble its price action prior to Halving #2.', 'Should this be the case, it would take Bitcoin a longer time to manage its typical post-Halving growth (after all, it took Bitcoin over 500 days post-Halving #2 to manage an over 12,000% rally to new ATHs).', 'If Bitcoin’s post-Halving #3 growth resembles Bitcoin’s post-Halving #2 growth, then Bitcoin may see a new All-Time High over 500 days after the Halving (i.e. by Quarter 4, 2021).', 'A retrace may very well occur prior to the Halving which would figure as a financial opportunity for both traders and investors alike.', 'Historically, Bitcoin has set a new All-Time High after every Halving.', 'Whatever All-Time High price Bitcoin reaches, this new record is most likely to take place many months after the Halving.', 'The amount of Bitcoin that gets created every 10 minutes gets cut in half every four years.', 'This is why the Bitcoin Halving has figured as an important catalyst that spurs significant growth in Bitcoin’s price.', 'It is an event that guarantees legitimate scarcity.', 'And the exponential appreciation in Bitcoin’s price is a testament to a very important principle in financial markets — scarcity enhances value.', 'It is important to develop an understanding as well as the ability to appreciate, with a level-head, the historical significance of the Bitcoin Halving effect on Bitcoin’s price.', 'After all, Bitcoin’s historical price action has shown the Bitcoin Halving to be a unique type of event that tends to make investors money — not only heading in to the Halving but many months after it as well.', 'The Bitcoin Halving is a simple narrative with high probability profits attached to it.', 'Of course, past performance doesn’t guarantee future outcomes.', 'But two things can be decisively said about history:', 'And in the words of Mark Twain:', 'Thank you for reading.', 'P.S.

I wasted the first two years of my blogging journey trying to impress my audience even though I wasn’t a native English speaker.', 'I learned most of my English in high school. And if you’ve ever taken a high school English class, you probably had to meet those word counts on papers. Add to that the pressure to satisfy your teacher’s demands by adding extra adjectives to “enrich your writing.”', 'Sophisticated writing is good writing, I learned from those academics.', 'Applying complex high school writing to Internet blogging didn’t work, though. I’m not sure how many posts I deleted during those two years, but I was never going to be a writer. Blaming my teachers didn’t help, nor did imposter syndrome or playing the victim of not being an English native.', 'On the positive side, such negative self-talk elicited a lot of questions.

Since verbs are the “engine” of your writing, choose powerful and accurate ones instead of tacking “-ly” words on to dull verbs.', 'No: The child cried loudly.', 'Yes: The child screamed.', '3 Avoid the passive voice: While the passive voice adds words to sentences, it also distances readers from what’s happening. Use the active voice whenever you can for crisper, more concise writing.', 'No: I was given a raise by my boss.', 'Yes: My boss gave me a raise.', '4 Delete “that” when you can: Unnecessary “thats” are like fat in a sentence.

In other words, I was angry.', 'Yes: I was angry.', '16 Nix “currently”: “Am,” “are,” and “is” imply “right now,” so using “currently” can make a sentence redundant.', 'No: I’m currently in a great mood.Yes: I’m in a great mood.', '17 Skip relative pronouns: Relative pronouns like “that” or “who” modify nouns, which means you can typically swap them out for adjectives.', 'No: The family searched for houses that had four bedrooms.', 'Yes: The family searched for four-bedroom houses.', '18 Reconsider “make”: Another common offender in wordiness: “make + adjective,” which writers often use in place of a verb that says the same thing more effectively.

Depending on with whom we are relating?', 'Is emotional availability something that we can choose consciously to turn on or off? Or is it an automatic reaction, instead determined by past experiences and inner temperament?', 'Different people bring out and activate varying traits and alternate sides of each of us. As in, with one partner or friend, we might be one way. While with another different partner or friend, we may find whole other parts of ourselves emerging into the spotlight, to even our own surprise.', 'Every love, connection, and reaction between two people is different. Layered with varying nuances, complexity, and feeling.', 'All human beings have moments of emotional unavailability. This is human.', 'We each have periods of being distracted by other things in our lives, during which we might not be emotionally open or available to someone whom we may care for and be close to. We might be wrestling with a situation within our own life so that when someone we love comes to us in emotional need, we aren’t able to see it fully or be completely receptive to such in that particular moment or phase in our own life.', 'Much like the skill of being a good listener, no one can be emotionally available (nor a good listener) 100% of the time. It just isn’t possible, despite even our best intentions.', 'With that said though, people do tend towards falling into one of two camps, meaning that generally people are either emotionally available, or they aren’t.', 'Small, distracted, temporary moments of emotional unavailability aside, people tend towards being either one temperament or the other in this regard.', 'Basically, being emotionally unavailable means that someone deeply struggles emotionally (and this is almost always related to fear) with love, with trusting in others, allowing themselves to be known on a deeper, soul level, and with exchanging complex emotions.', 'Can this vary, depending on the person with whom we are connecting?', 'Absolutely. It isn’t an across-the-board given response (though of course, it can be). Often times, we may find ourselves opening up more easily with some, feeling safer, braver with certain people, and then finding ourselves more hesitant with others.', 'Emotional availability is about sharing yourself with someone over time, to develop that connection in an authentic way.', 'Being emotionally available means being reachable.', 'It’s both the ability to feel deeply, as well as to communicate those deep feelings to others.', 'Emotional availability is being able to sit with difficult, upsetting, or challenging emotions, both in yourself and in others, and to not run away from, dismiss, or attempt to minimize them.', 'It means being able to be with someone who is in pain and not trying to fix it. Instead, just being a loving, brave, mindful presence with that person.', 'Emotional availability means being open to, comfortable with, and courageous in the face of all human emotions and experiences (not just the easy, light, or positive ones). Being able to face both the beautiful, the light, and the good, as well as the painful, difficult and the dark.', 'The short answer is that typically people who struggle with being emotionally available are those who have traumatic, complicated histories. Emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, neglect or abandonment in their past.', ""People who have trouble being emotionally available are essentially afraid. It's an attempt at self-protection. An attempt at self-soothing and guarding oneself against harm, in a sense."", 'However, this is a learned behavior. And thus, it is one that can be unlearned.', ""The problem with choosing emotional unavailability is this: it's a half-way to love."", 'If you never allow yourself to open totally to another person, to trust, to let go and draw towards them, you miss out on awesome loves and powerful, emotionally fulfilling, incredible connections.', 'Ultimately, being emotionally available means allowing yourself to be fully known to another.', 'Being willing to show them the light, as well as the dark. Sharing the inner parts of your heart with another, and trusting in their receiving of it.', 'Being emotionally available means being willing to “go there” from time to time, to develop true intimacy. “Going there” means talking about the ugly truths, the insecurities, the complexities that reside in each of us, the “this is not OK for me” boundaries.', 'A person who is not emotionally available attempts bypassing these things because it feels too unsafe, too unsure, too ugly.', 'To grow into a more emotionally available person (which essentially means that, the more emotionally available you are, the deeper and more poignant your connections to others can be, as well as, the healthier and more satisfying relationships you will have), you need to “go there” with yourself first.', 'To get comfortable with seeing uncomfortable things about your behavior, history, and experiences. As well as, to grow comfortable in sitting with the difficult emotions of others as well.', 'When your body is crawling inward, wanting to run or feeling uneasy, instead of retreating emotionally or literally, deciding on breathing and staying. Working through it. Leaning towards difficult or painful emotions in both yourself as well as those you love.', 'They create walls and rifts, where instead there could be closeness and connection. Relationships require trust, tenderness, patience, and vulnerability. Anxious people often have these traits and offerings in abundance, but it takes bravery and internal work for them to move towards instead of away from these relational benchmarks.', 'Again though, this is something that can be learned.', 'Absolutely. Humans are always capable of change. We are infinitely complex beings. Temperaments, moods, personalities, emotions, all ever in flux and thus continually shifting, growing, changing.', 'In fact, with regards to a person who struggles with emotional openness in general, this is rarely a stable, static thing in someone. Instead, it’s a response that tends more towards flexing and flowing.', 'People who struggle with allowing themselves to be emotionally available have many moments in which they do allow their hearts to open. Times during which they bravely take emotional steps towards someone (instead of away) to whom they wish to grow closer. They have periods of allowing their guards to lower.', 'And then at other times, they may dance into emotional retreat. Drawing back, taking a few steps in the other direction, tentative and cautious.', 'Rarely is a person entirely closed off all the time (though of course, there are people like that too). Instead, people who struggle with emotional bravery tend to have moments of strength, trust, and openness, coupled with times of caution, fear, and guardedness.', 'This is where patience comes in for the people who love and truly want to grow closer to them.', 'Some ways to move toward emotional availability, as well as, to help bridge the distance that can be created when struggling with this in a relationship:', '1. Let your partner (as well as friends and family members with whom you are close since emotional availability applies to all relationships, not just romantic) in on what you’re thinking and feeling.', 'Be willing to “go there”, even if it isn’t always ideal. Risk telling them what is going on inside of you. The beautiful and light, along with the challenging, darker stuff, both of which we all have inside of ourselves.', 'Keeping too much to yourself has a way of widening distance between people instead of closing it.', '2. Be willing to be vulnerable. Vulnerability — being open to another — is beautiful and is the essence of successful, healthy, close relationships.', 'The problem with protecting yourself too much is that it can result and invite in the very thing you are attempting protection against, which is loss and heartbreak. This is a risk in any close relationship already, one that’s impossible to escape and is unavoidable: loss.', 'However, better not to have caused it by being your own worst enemy.', 'Intimacy (and emotional availability) is letting someone in closer than you let the rest of the world. It’s trusting that person with the fragile, messy, untamed parts of you — the parts that are often beautiful, sometimes baffling, and always okay with the person who loves you.', '3. Tough conversations can bring you closer. People often avoid talking about the difficult stuff, afraid of being off-putting or feeling concerned about what it might do to the relationship.', 'Instead, trust that you and this trusted loved one can cope with the challenge of whatever this topic or discussion might entail.', 'Much of life is beautiful, magical, and fantastic, however, life also contains sadness, challenge, and heartbreak. Trust that your loved one can empathize with, be open to, and inhabit both of these aspects of life along with you.', 'And if they cannot, it doesn’t indicate that emotional availability is a bad thing, though instead, more likely indicates that maybe this person is not the right choice as someone to gift with these parts of yourself.', ""4. Let your partner (or friend, or family member) in on what it's like to be you. Human beings are complex, complicated creatures. Bringing someone in closer to you and your story is the lifeblood of intimacy. Sharing your anxieties, triggers, dreams, fears, and inner experiences with another, these are the bridges to growing close with someone."", '5. Have fun together. Closeness is also bridged within laughter, shared adventures, fun experiences, and the building of marvelous memories together. The more moments you share with someone, this tends towards bringing two people closer. Laughter tightens connections. It soothes tension. Sharing positive experiences with someone (as well as challenging ones) tightens your bond.', '6. Patience. The surest way to push someone away further who is struggling with fear of opening up and being emotionally vulnerable is attempting to pull them closer to you too quickly or forcefully. Allow them their own process. Being patient, open, and loving is the way for them to slowly though surely grow towards feeling more comfortable, safer, and for their trust and comfort in you to set forth blooming.', 'People can be unavailable for both healthy and unhealthy reasons.', 'They may have suffered through a troubled childhood experience that has wounded them, or they currently have other priorities such as taking care of a sick parent which doesn’t exactly coincide with being able to be fully present and be a great friend during that time.', 'Perhaps, they are recently divorced or widowed and are legitimately not ready to get involved in an intimate relationship. Then, there are those who are too afraid of taking the risk of falling in love or revealing themself to another because they have been hurt too much in their previous relationships.', 'However, those in the latter category are the ones with an important choice to make.', 'Continue forward dragging along such baggage, resulting in the potential loss of wonderful future relationships, or, work through and let go of past hurts and be willing to risk opening up and moving towards being willing to trust in something new.', ""If a person's primary reason for being emotionally closed off is because of past romantic hurts, well, they need remember that no two loves are the same. Each relationship is different. When you equate one as being the same with previous others, you make a grave error."", 'Every relationship is a clean slate.', 'A new experience, bringing together two brand new elements which will result in a completely different and unique output from the last one(s).', 'It often simply means they’ve had emotionally exhausting or traumatic experiences and might need to approach things more tentatively initially…at the very least, at the beginning of the relationship.', 'Falling in love, as well as growing emotionally close to someone platonically, is meant to be magical, and frankly, it is awe-inspiring, incredibly emotionally fulfilling, and absolutely awesome. It is a high point of the experience of being alive, as well as human.', 'But, getting close to another person isn’t without its highs and lows. From the ecstasy of realizing that someone pretty amazing is as moved by you as you are by them, to the tension and pain of self-doubt and possible loss, to the security, richness, comfort, and sometimes stillness of deeper love, intimacy is a vehicle for a plethora of varying emotions.', 'Anxiety and emotional caution can and does affect many relationships. If not addressed and worked through, it can take away from, and even cause the otherwise unnecessary ending of some relationships.', 'However, by being open to and deliberate in responding to the challenge of emotional availability, in turning bravely toward this type of response and behavior in your close connections with others, you can create relationships that are immensely emotionally fulfilling, strong, close, joy-filled, and resilient.', 'Check out more about Brooke at brookeenglish.com']"

Buchheit, who also happens to be the creator of Gmail, describes the brainstorm session to author Jessica Livingston in her book Founders at Work:', '“It just, sort of, occurred to me that ‘don’t be evil’ is kind of funny,” he says. “It’s also a bit of a jab at a lot of the other companies, especially our competitors, who at the time, in our opinion, were kind of exploiting the users to some extent.”', 'Ironically, that is exactly what many individuals are now accusing the tech giant of doing. Which begs the question:', 'Has Google morphed into the very thing it vowed never to become?', 'Google’s corporate mission is to: “Organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.”', 'What was originally a humble search engine is now also a business SaaS provider, a maps purveyor and a pioneer of Artificial Intelligence. Obviously, Google deserves a huge amount of praise, appreciation and gratitude for its many contributions to the world.', 'But many individuals now claim the tech giant has become greedy, untrustworthy and “too powerful.”', 'History is abundant with examples of corporations, world leaders and politicians who adopt win-lose mentalities while climbing to the top.', 'However, we’re in an unprecedented territory — Google is running a monopoly that affects how some of the 7.7 billion people on the planet obtain and interact with information; information that allows them to make both important and inconsequential decisions alike.', 'Yes, competitors like Yahoo, Bing and DuckDuckGo exist, but the primary-colored provider maintains 93 percent of search engine market share worldwide. In conjunction with Facebook, the company also commands nearly 85 percent of the Internet’s advertising dollars.', 'This monopolization combined with a growing public concern over data collection, and Google’s increasing omnipresence over daily life, has the tech giant facing increased scrutiny.', 'As the founder and CEO of Ahrefs (a search engine optimization toolkit), I spend significant time considering how the Internet might be improved upon for authors, entrepreneurs and makers. As such, I’m most concerned with Google’s increasing number of win-lose decisions concerning content creators.', 'One of those decisions involves a feature called “Featured Snippets.” These selected search results, displayed above organic results and below ads, feature scraped content from websites. The snippets attempt to immediately answer search queries, like this one:', 'While the feature does provide convenience, it’s often criticized for presenting search-goers with inaccurate information. It also reduces monetization opportunities for content creators like Brian Warner, founder of CelebrityNetWorth.com.', 'In 2008, Warner started a small media business to detail celebrity financial information. He employed around a dozen people to research, maintain and publish it.', 'As reported by The Week, Google contacted Warner for permission to scrape his data before launching “Featured Snippets.” Warner says that he declined the offer, but Google still scraped his content.', 'The worst part? His traffic dipped 65 percent within a month, causing him to reduce his staff by half. Not cool, Google.', 'More recently, Genius Media Group Inc. told the Wall Street Journal that its traffic is dropping because Google has been publishing its lyrics without attribution. Genius relies upon the search engine to direct music fans to its site where they can find lyrics to popular songs.', 'The company reportedly “caught” Google by using a series of alternating straight and curved apostrophes within its lyrics that revealed the words “red handed” when converted to Morse Code. As reported by The Verge, the complaint comes on the heels of an impending antitrust investigation against Google by the U.S.Department of Justice.', 'Such controversies suggest a disregard for the small entrepreneur whose content is scraped and traffic is reduced. However, is that really the best way to treat the content publishers who made your huge success possible?', 'It’s no secret that Google would have nothing if no one ever published anything online. In the beginning, we assumed the arrangement of self-publishing in exchange for free traffic was fair.', 'And, for a while, maybe it was. During the pre-search era, businesses were limited to attracting customers via expensive print advertisements, radio ads and curb appeal.', 'However, look closely, and you will notice something remarkable about the whole thing:', 'Google convinced us to write, produce and publish content on its behalf without paying us a dime.', 'You know who else follows a similar business model?', 'Newspapers. The primary difference, of course, is that print publications use their ad revenue to pay journalists. Let’s just take a moment to marvel at the genius of Google’s decision to flip the traditional publishing model on its head.', 'The company created something so revolutionary, and so valuable, that its users never even question the fact that Google makes approximately $100 billion in annual ad revenue from the content its users work so hard to make.', 'I don’t know any journalists, besides college interns, who would willingly write free articles for The New York Times, The Washington Post or The Wall Street Journal. To be clear, I am not saying Google is doing something evil.', 'The platform provides the general public with a useful service at seemingly no cost. However, the keyword is “seemingly.”', 'Unbeknownst to many, Google isn’t truly free. The search platform’s advertising costs affect users similar to how gasoline prices affect non-drivers. Translation: Just because you don’t fill up a tank doesn’t mean you don’t pay for the price of fuel in the products and services you purchase.', 'While I don’t think Google is bad for developing this ingenious business model, I do believe $100 billion is too high a valuation for the service they provide — about 10 times too high.', 'Which leads to a thought-provoking question:', 'Why didn’t Google ever embrace YouTube’s business model after acquiring the company in 2006?', 'YouTube utilizes a profit-share model that inspires everyone from celebrities to stay-at-home moms to produce quality content. In lieu of shared ad revenue, professionally produced channels like this, simply wouldn’t exist.', 'Being venture-backed, Google’s success is measured in terms of growth — not fairness. Sharing ad revenue with content creators would massively dilute the company’s valuation. Due to increasing pressure from investors, Google continually releases new features that make them richer at the expense of content creators.', 'Are they “evil” for making that decision? No, but it begs the question posed by Reddit-user Mondrahgon: When is enough, enough [in regards to growth]?', 'Google is unlikely to share its wealth anytime soon. However, that doesn’t mean an alternative search provider couldn’t introduce some healthy competition.', 'So, here’s what I propose:', 'In this regard, the authors could make a living by publishing helpful content.', 'This business model would allow renowned experts, independent journalists and passionate individuals to spend time creating high-value content; the kind of articles that just can’t be regularly produced on the side of a 9-to-5.', 'Say, you love pancakes more than anything else in the world. Imagine getting paid to share creative recipes, take photos and instruct website visitors on how they too can make amazing pancakes.', 'With a search profit-sharing model, you wouldn’t need to fill your pages with advertisements, sell baking pans or ask for donations via Patreon in order to turn that dream into a reality. Add to that the ability to create unbiased content, as your content will finally earn based on value, not by hard-plugging some sleazy affiliate links.', 'Alternatively, a citizen journalist uncovering corruption on the side of a full-time job, could start earning more while spending less time trying to monetize content. After “going full-time,” the person might invest additional profits into user-friendly databases that organize complex research for public use. Honestly, the possibilities are endless.', 'If either scenario sounds like a stretch, again, look no further than YouTube. The chart below depicts the platform’s biggest earners:', 'YouTube’s revenue for 2018 is estimated at between $9.5 billion and $14 billion. Analysts estimate the platform’s creators earn as little as $0.35, or as much as $5, per 1,000 views.', 'Unfortunately, YouTube doesn’t publish much information about its financials. However, using this table, we can approximate that top-earners receive $0.0015 for every one view.', 'Considering how much more ad revenue Google SEPR clicks generate in comparison to YouTube views, a Google profit-share model could generate significantly higher returns for top content creators.', 'Based on a quick analysis, serving one search could pay an average rate from $0.05 to $0.25 in the US. Say Anne from Kentucky helps 4,000 people learn how to build container gardens via her Wordpress blog every month. She would receive $1,000 monthly from the search engine in return.', 'That extra income might go toward feeding her family, saving for her kid’s college education or marketing her site to generate even more monthly views.', 'This is just one example of how a moderately successful content creator would be significantly impacted by a 90–10 profit share model. The system would further encourage the best, brightest and most diligent content publishers to rise to the top.', 'And who wouldn’t benefit from that? Even if you aren’t a content publisher yourself, wouldn’t it be cool to stumble across more high-quality researchers, educators and writers? I think so.', 'The Internet is a global effort to preserve knowledge, free speech and equal opportunity for humankind. Fundamentally, no one should “own” something meant for the good of all.', 'Those who wish to protect the Internet from unfavorable economic forces must begin taking small steps to challenge the status quo.', 'For this reason, Ahrefs is publically committing to build a general-purpose search engine based on a 90/10 profit-share model. I first introduced this idea back in March:', 'Some people cheered me on, while others questioned my sanity in competing with a multi-billion-dollar company.', 'But here’s the thing: Someone always has to be the first when challenging existing norms. So, why not Ahrefs?', 'Here’s our plan moving forward:', 'The concept of receiving automatic direct payments in exchange for publishing content on the Web may sound “too good to be true” to some. However, that’s only because they have grown accustomed to an arguably unfair search model.', 'Over the next several months, we’ll be publishing more content to illustrate how profit share would benefit content publishers and Internet searchers alike. Increased content quality, financial opportunity and creative freedom are just some of these benefits.', 'We would be thrilled for any major provider to “run with our idea,” but we aren’t counting on it. Which is why Ahrefs has already begun developing a new search engine with profit-share capabilities behind the scenes.', 'Finally, we are open to providing access to our crawl data to help other players enter the search field and foster competition.', 'Our ultimate goal: Attract the attention of larger companies like Microsoft who can afford to bring the idea to scale. In case you didn’t know, the tech giant owns the less-frequently-used search engine Bing.', 'Considering the platform only generates a fraction of the company’s $120 billion revenue, the organization could easily revamp Bing under a profit-share model. It’s my prediction that the positive public sentiment alone would have greater ROI than existing ad revenue. If we succeed in our endeavors, Google will finally get some long overdue competition for search.', 'Companies like Firefox are now testing $5/month subscriptions for ad-free news, and Medium is successfully attracting some of the Internet’s best writers with its compensation model. Could our search platform grow into something groundbreaking following similar premises?', 'Honestly, we’re not sure.

09/2019	AI for portfolio management: from Markowitz to Reinforcement Learning	Optimization? Learning? Control?	1.5K	2	https://medium.com/@alexrachnog	https://medium.com/swlh/ai-for-portfolio-management-from-markowitz-to-reinforcement-learning-cffedcbba566?source=collection_archive---------5-----------------------	12	8	['AI for portfolio management: from Markowitz to Reinforcement Learning', 'Classical optimization', 'Unsupervised learning', 'Supervised learning', 'Reinforcement learning', 'Evaluation in the wild', 'Other approaches', 'Conclusions']	34	['Artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data, and other buzzwords are disrupting decision making in almost any area of finance. On the back office, machine learning is widely applied to spot anomalies in execution logs, for risk management and fraudulent transaction detection. At the front office, AI is used for customer segmentation and support and pricing the derivatives.', 'But of course, the most interesting applications of AI in finance are in the buy-side and are related to searching the predictive signal in the noise and catching that alpha. They include but are not restricted to time series forecasting, the regime-switching detection, market segmentation, and, of course, asset portfolio management.', 'This article is fully devoted to the latter problem — we will review classical mathematical methods for optimizing portfolio, unsupervised, supervised machine learning approaches, reinforcement learning agents and some more exotic options. The material of this topic is tightly correlated with the inner expertise of Neurons Lab where I am co-founder and CTO and the course I was teaching at UCU data science summer school. As always, you can find all source code on GitHub and the results of the experiments further in this article.', 'The task title is already telling us that we’re working on the optimization problem: maximizing or minimizing some function with respect to its parameters. In our case, we would like to maximize returns while minimizing the risk with respect to the amount of money we allocate on each asset in our portfolio. In the layman terms:', 'We have $1M and we need to split it among different assets (or leave in cash) in such a way, that at the end of some time period this $1M grows as much as it can with minimal risk of losing the money.', 'If we assume, that all investors on the market are rational, avoid risks whenever possible and aim to maximize their expected returns we can plot all possible portfolios on the 2D plot with risk and expected returns as axis:', 'The optimal decision can be found with maximizing expected returns (calculated from the previous movements of the asset) and minimizing associated risk (as volatility of the assets). The ratio of expected return divided by risk is called Sharpe ratio and the portfolio with the maximal Sharpe ratio can be found with a rather standard optimization toolkit.', 'Of course, there are a lot of different optimization criteria we might aim for. What if we even don’t care about the expected returns and just want to minimize the risk?', 'Or maybe we want to diversify our portfolio as most as we can?', 'Or probably invest only in decorrelated assets? Or maybe assure the equality of the risks in each of the assets?', 'Check more examples of optimization criteria here, the most important part about it is that you can design them yourself taking care of your own business objectives.', 'Also, the portfolio optimization problem looks a lot like unsupervised learning task or representation learning task: having a set of assets we need to group them into some “clusters” based on their profitability and after allocate more funds on the most predictive ones and less on the opposite side. What algorithms could we use for this purpose?', 'One of the first unsupervised learning models you get familiar with at the machine learning class is a principal component analysis (PCA). It decomposes multidimensional data into the set of linearly uncorrelated variables, where the first such variable (also called principal component) is explaining the most variation in the data, and all next variables are sorted by having the maximal variance while being orthogonal to the previous variable. How we can use it for portfolio management? Many ideas are published, the most common one says that the first principal component serves as an approximation of the market, hence, choosing second and other components will give uncorrelated to the market strategies, which is what most of the investors want.', 'PCA is a great tool, but it relies only on the linear dependence between the data axis. One of the alternatives, that allows non-linear dimensionality reduction, is based on neural networks — autoencoders. They can “squeeze” input data into some low-dimensional vector and after restore input from this representation. The idea of autoencoder can be exploited in many ways for portfolio selection, one of them is related to the evaluation of the risk carried by the particular asset: if some asset movement can’t be restored well (the predicted value differs a lot from the input in terms of, let’s say, mean squared error) from the low-dimensional representation — it’s associated with higher risk (and, possibly, higher profits). Please, see an example of this kind of portfolio in the experiments section.', 'One of the optimization-based portfolio management methods is a risk parity model. It is also stated as an optimization problem, where we allocate rather the risk than the capital resources. The problem of this approach (and, actually, most of the approaches described in this article) matures when we’re working with portfolios of very huge size — if we represent connections between assets geometrically, they will be in the form of the complete graph (see image above), which is an over-complication in the world of hierarchies. The solution lies again in unsupervised learning, but with the exploitation of the hierarchical clustering algorithms applied to the covariance matrix. After finding clusters of the assets, we can re-allocate risk over them recursively. The high-level procedure described below:', 'The optimization and representation approaches look cool and legit, but they have one major drawback: they just exploit information about the past asset movements and co-correlations without any assumptions about their future behavior. Do we agree that in the future assets will move the same as in the past? Not really! That’s why we need some ways to exploit predictions about the future as the allocation weights.', 'The idea is rather very straightforward: if we can use any model to predict the price movement in the future, we can use this prediction as to the allocation weight. Of course, we need to normalize these predictions so their sum is equal to one, but this is rather a technical step and can be done or with the softmax with tuned temperature, or even with the single L1-normalization. Nice point here is, that we also can take into account associated risk of prediction if we work with Bayesian machine learning or models like ARIMA. In this article, we will use the simplest forecasting algorithm: exponential smoothing, but you can easily extend it to, for example, deep learning with the use of other tutorials from my blog.', 'How about diving deeper and treating asset allocation not just as a one-step optimization problem, but as continuous control of the portfolio with the delayed reward? Let’s move from optimal allocation to optimal control territory and in a data-driven world, it can be solved via various reinforcement learning algorithms. They don’t do predictions and don’t learn the structure of the market implicitly. They do more: directly learn the policy of changing the weights dynamically in the continuously changing market!', 'The idea of Q-learning applied to portfolio management is the following: we can describe the market with some state s_t and with doing some action on this market and going to the state s_{t+1} we get a reward (changed value of our portfolio based on the weights we applied). The name “Q-learning” comes from the Q(s, a) function, that based on the market state s and provided action a (in our case, it’s allocation weights) returns the expected reward. Today this function can be approximated with deep neural networks and we can train such a model to optimize for a Sharpe ratio or any other criteria, but not just for a single allocation, but for a sequence of portfolio allocations, where we will exploit trained Q function for choosing the optimal actions. If you will check the source code for details, please notice, that for continuous action space with Deep Reinforcement Learning we need to use some tricks.', 'The above review is nothing without some quantitative evaluation on the real data. I suggest two following benchmarks:', 'In both cases, we will use equal allocation as a benchmark and compare all the models we discussed previously quantitatively. The animations below show both equity curves and allocations weights (click on image to zoom and see allocations better). Also, please, check out the code on GitHub.', 'Note: these experiments are shown for the visualization and presentation purposes only. In real life, asset management algorithms have to re-weight allocations and be re-trained over time more carefully including hyperparameter search. Also, they need to be tested and evaluated in a much more rigorous manner. Last but not least, strong risk management system has to be built over any of your trading strategies, nevertheless they perform in backtesting or paper trading mode.', 'In this experiment, we are using 180 trading days for making the decision (estimating covariance matrix, forecasting time series, fitting autoencoder or RL agent, etc) and for the next 180 days, we are holding the assets with respect to the weights found by the algorithm. After this holding period, the re-weighting procedure starts again.', 'In the case of the cryptocurrency portfolio, we have selected 180 days for the decision-making period and reduced holding time to three months due to the understanding that the market is very volatile.', 'Summarized performance metrics you can find in the tables below.', 'We can conclude, that indeed machine learning models can beat the market benchmark in terms of Sharpe ratio and in some cases perform better than classical optimization models. The best performance is shown in both cases by PCA portfolios, or RL agent portfolios because of their ability to learn the market structure, with more good options on the cryptocurrency market, which can be explained by its immaturity and relative predictability. I want to underline again, that all the models mentioned before have to be tuned and tested more carefully before being used in production.', 'As we can see, hierarchical risk parity in both benchmarks is allocating almost 100% of the capital on a single asset. Since I’ve used the code of the author and didn’t spot any mistake there, I’ve decided to make a lask check of its performance on some “random” portfolio that includes popular assets from AAPL and GOOGL to MCD, SBUX, and BTC. In this case, it performs adequately and, if tuned carefully, outperforms the equal allocation benchmark. See more details on the source code.', 'In this article, RL is implemented only as a proof-of-concept of multidimensional continuos-reward control, purely trained and evaluated on the in-sample data. Also, it tends to learn exploitation instead of exploitation more, which is another sign of ill setup. Last but not least, the input for the Q function approximation was the covariance matrix which might be not the best option. For the production use, more careful work is needed but this example can serve as a starting point.', 'Of course, asset management algorithms are not restricted to the above-mentioned ones. If we’re talking about optimization-based portfolios, it’s worth to take a look on: evolutionary algorithms that can replace classical optimization algorithms for complex target functions and huge portfolios, multicriteria optimization that will allow you to find the balance between a lot of different optimization targets, Litterman Portfolio and, of course, celebrated CAPM.', 'If you liked the idea behind unsupervised learning, I suggest taking a look at generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders as the models that are showing the best results in generative modeling and factor learning today. They can help with learning market structure and hidden driving factors even more precisely.', 'Last but not least, optimal control direction looks like the most promising one: apart of reinforcement learning and related approaches, it’s worth to take a look at more mathematically grounded models like Stochastic Portfolio Theory.', 'What to do next? That’s a good question. It mainly depends on your portfolio, your markets and at which point of the development you’re at the moment. If you’re just starting with wealth management and use some “classical” approaches, I really suggest you playing with unsupervised learning methods as HRP and PCA. They contain less risk than forecasting based methods or reinforcement learning and allows you a better interpretation of the results. If you’re an experienced quantitative asset manager, I believe that optimal control and reinforcement learning is the next frontier to explore and exploit. Also, see Lopez de Prado’s book on correct cross-validation of ML models and backtesting of the algorithms.', 'In any case, whether you’re just starting working on quantitative investments or you already have a lot of complex developments, don’t hesitate to contact us at Neurons Lab.

By all accounts, he should have it all together. But when I compare him to my friends who are twenty, juggling two minimum-wage jobs, and don’t know what to do with their lives, guess who comes out happier?', 'Wealth can be a source of many problems, first of all because of the responsibility you feel towards it. The average rich person spends more time thinking about money than the average normal person. Some of this thought is necessary, but your riches can easily consume your life.', 'The problem is it’s so easy to chase more because it isn’t as clear that the upper extreme is harmful.', 'In other words, everyone knows that not having enough money for food is objectively bad, but few people know that doing a job you hate for the sole purpose of growing your bank balance is harmful.', 'The overall perception of wealth is too skewed and too powerful for most to realize that there are murky parts of the rich pond, too.', 'I learned that everyone has the same problems, so it’s your framework for approaching the world that matters the most. Can you deal with disappointment? How do you conceptualize time? What are your core values, and how do you maintain them? How do you spend your time, and why? All these things matter more than your wealth.', 'But as hard as it is to get rich, statistically speaking, the money is actually the easier path. Fixing yourself is harder.', 'There’s two sides to this one: The tactical side and the wellness side.', 'You don’t need to have it, you just have to know someone who does.', 'Growing up around people who have influence and know how to use it was one of the most valuable experiences I’ve ever had. It teaches you to be resourceful, not just in terms of your physical resources but also your connections.', 'For instance, the main reason I got my first job as an editor, without any work experience or qualifications, was because I used my connections to some people in the company.', 'I knew that my qualifications wouldn’t get me anywhere (because I had none). So to get this job, I had to bank on the relationships I built with various decision makers and employees of the company. In other words, I was more likely to get hired because I was a friend, rather than because I was qualified.', 'Of course, I was actually well-equipped to do the job, as I proved very quickly when I got it, but the issue was my surface-level credentials (or lack thereof) would have turned people away before I could prove myself.', 'The best part is you don’t actually need to be wealthy to take advantage of this. It’s just about building genuine human connections, which you can do no matter what.', 'The best part about being rich isn’t the caviar or the strippers, it’s the variety you can afford.', 'As kids, my sister and I got to travel to Australia and New Zealand once a year, and stepping into such a different culture periodically was without question one of the reasons we turned out thoughtful, aware, and curious.', 'Why is this so important? Because at the end of the day, wealth stored as wisdom has the most longevity.', 'After all, maintaining wealth is actually pretty hard. You need to have a framework which recognizes the unique value money has in your life and sets you up to continue watering that tree, all while staying happy. And such a healthy wealth mindset comes from wisdom, which is derived from breadth of knowledge.', 'Which is why I learned that it’s not so much what you own, it’s what kind of people you know. I mean, a rich doctor probably knows other doctors. But does he know farmers? Does he know fishermen? Does he know trust-fund babies? Does he know street food hawkers?', 'Diversity of knowledge and the drive to continually expand it are some of the most positive traits you can possess.', 'What’s my biggest takeaway after twenty years of wealth and counting?', 'Money shouldn’t be placed on a pedestal. There are real problems out there, and this ain’t one of them.']

So, there’s that! The other response you’d likely get to “What leadership activities are you chasing this week?” is Buzzword Boulevard: “I’m working on organic feedback in a mission-driven way.” Both of these answers mean absolutely nothing, and would not help someone become a better leader or manager down the road.', 'So, what are the leadership activities people need to focus on? I’d argue most of them are probably soft skills, which terrifies a lot of executives. Why? Executives are about execution — not about fluffy stuff like “communicating better.” They want to run their business via The Spreadsheet Mentality, and not run it via “I need to give Johnny his precious feedback.” It’s a real issue. We often gloss it over.', 'We’ve also got research on eight crucially effective leadership skills, and research on what leadership skills lists should look like for executives. But those are lists of skills — they’re not actions and activities, per se. What do we know about leadership activities?', 'Here’s a new article called “The Most Important Leadership Competencies According To Leaders Around The World.” Seems noble. It’s 195 leaders from 15 countries and 30 organizations/industries. Not a huge sample size, but what can we learn about leadership activities?

We need better managers in companies, plain and simple — and right now we lack that, and big time. How do we get to better managers focused on the right leadership activities, as opposed to a bunch of supposedly urgent bullshit over here?', 'This is the path that needs to be traced, methinks:', 'In an ideal world (which does not exist), senior leaders would not be individual contributors. Instead, they would focus on the high-level stuff described above. (While seeking input from others.) Middle managers and front-line guys/girls would focus on the people and developing them. A lot of the boxes and reporting that middle/front-line guys used to be has been replaced or automated with technology and software suites. And yet, a lot of managers still spend hours and hours on those types of things — essentially box-checking that Oracle could do for them. What if those managers focused on people and aligning people’s skill sets to big-picture priorities? What a wonderful time to be alive!', 'People spend most of their week sitting in meetings or on calls — or checking email. Since nary a soul has prepared for any call/meeting, and since e-mail is the biggest joke society has wrought on us all, these are not necessarily “productive” uses of time. That doesn’t matter, of course — the goal isn’t productivity, it’s to be seen as useful or essential.

We live in a very rapid-fire, do-it-now, get-it-done type of culture, especially around work. This leads to a lot of emails flying in with no context aside from “Do this for me.” You often don’t understand the background, the stakeholders, the value of the project, how it will be analyzed, etc. My brother-in-law was just telling me this story. At work, he gets an email with an Excel attachment. The sender (higher up the chain than him) is like “Need feedback for Dan.” That’s it. That is the whole email. You’d probably wonder:', 'Good leadership activities = explaining the Excel, who needs it, why, the end goal, Dan’s role, etc. Bad leadership activities = low-context, mostly-bullshit slop fest that was sent. See the difference?', 'People have been managing other people for centuries (millennia?) and no one has really gotten this right. (Some thought leader just meowed: “Google has!”) It’s hard. Management’s not intuitive. The whole thing is a challenge.', 'Leadership activities need to emerge from priority, and roles need to be redefined to maximize people — especially if automation is coming fast and furious, and many of our roles will be adjusted anyway.', 'What else would you add on leadership activities?']

And because of the lack of income during that time, our budget was really tight. Hence we used Airbnb apartments A LOT, instead of booking expensive hotels or uncomfortable hostels. And when we came back we tried to think of what we had learned and how we could change our lives in the future. We thought of all the people we had met including our Airbnb hosts. Our hosts were nice, middle class people. They were very hospitable but had no special skills or knowledge. Just regular people, like us.', 'And then we thought: “Let’s try and start a side-hustle, an Airbnb business. Let’s find an apartment and rent it out on Airbnb. It can’t be that difficult.” Oh boy, were we wrong. We rented an apartment, we bought furniture and decorations, and we created our profile. We had some good guests and some bad guests but overall the business was going well. Within the first month we became ‘Superhosts’ and booked out all rooms\xa0(If\xa0you\xa0want\xa0to\xa0find\xa0out\xa0how\xa0we\xa0did\xa0it,\xa0check\xa0out\xa0my\xa0other\xa0article)\xa0. It was everything but easy, but we made it. Until we ran into some issues with the neighbors threatening to sue us, so we had to close shop after just one and a half months.', 'And then we thought: “Let’s try and start a side-hustle, an Airbnb business. Let’s find an apartment and rent it out on Airbnb. It can’t be that difficult.” Oh boy, were we wrong.', 'Now, fast forward to a few months back, I get a call from a former customer. He said he had a friend who would need a website for renting out apartments on Airbnb (I work as a freelance web designer). Why he would need a website for THAT was beyond my understanding. Anyways, I asked my customer if he needed professional pictures also. He said ‘Yes’. So my girlfriend, who is a photographer, and I went up to his house. It was a beautiful villa with 6 apartments and a single guest-house. We met with the customer, discussed the details and took the pictures. The guy was nice, so afterwards we sat down with him and gave him some tips on how to run an Airbnb. We told him about our struggles and our achievements, about how you need to communicate constantly with the guests (preferably in English, the owner couldn’t speak English). And he listened and eventually said ‘I thought it wouldn’t be that difficult. You just set it up and rent it out. Easy! ’. I had to laugh at myself at that moment because that’s the same thing I had said just a year ago. He wasn’t aware of the work that was just coming up. He added. ‘An acquaintance of mine offered to manage the Airbnb for 40% of the revenue, but that’s just crazy’. So in response, as a joke, I told him that I would do it for half of that. We all laughed, but I saw the worrisome expression on his face.', 'I thought it wouldn’t be that difficult. You just set it up and rent it out. Easy!', 'After we left, a few days passed until the customer called me again. He told me he actually didn´t need a website for Airbnb ( ‘Duh’ ), just the pictures and the texts. And then he asked me if I had been serious about the offer to manage the Airbnb for him. I thought about it and said yes.', 'So that’s how I got my first apartment listings on Airbnb without owning, renting or investing any of my own money. I organized a cleaning lady, set up the Airbnb profile and the self-check-in systems. My main job is communicating via smartphone with the customer (home-owner), the cleaning lady and all the guests. It takes about 15 min — 2 hours per day (depending on how many bookings come in). This one job gets me up to 1500€ per month. This is not much, but given the working hours and that I work from wherever I want, it’s pretty good. In addition, the customer referred me to a couple of his friends, who are homeowners as well and would like to rent their space on Airbnb. As a cherry on top I create Airbnb accounts for each customer with my referral code to get me up to 250€ referral bonus for each referral and the customer(or anyone who uses my code) also get’s a Bonus of up to 200€ after the first guest. So, currently I am working on multiple projects managing Airbnb profiles.', 'Over the last few months, I found out that there are plenty of investors who buy or even just rent apartments, houses and even whole apartment buildings for the purpose of renting it out on Airbnb. But they are ‘investors’, not managers. Investors want to invest money and get healthy returns on them, and that’s where I or you or anyone with decent management skills comes into play.', 'So grab your first investor and start managing. How difficult could it be?', 'Are you looking to find other ways to earn a side hustle?

They are based on the JSON format and includes a token signature to ensure the integrity of the token.', 'Today, we are going to talk about the security implications of using JSON web tokens (and signature-based tokens in general), and how they can be exploited by attackers to bypass access control.', 'A JSON web token consists of three components: a header, a payload, and a signature.', 'The header section of a JSON web token identifies the algorithm used to generate the signature. It is a base64url encoded string of a JSON blob like this:', '(Base64url encoding is a modified version of base64 for the URL format. It is similar to base64, but uses different non-alphanumeric characters and omits padding. )', 'The most common algorithms used are HMAC and RSA algorithms.', 'The payload section contains the information that is actually used for access control. This section, too, is base64url encoded before being used in the token.', 'The signature is the part that is used to validate that the token has not been tampered with. It is calculated by concatenating the header with the payload, then signing with the algorithm specified in the header.', 'For this specific token, the string “eyBhbGcgOiBIUzI1NiwgdHlwIDogSldUIH0K.eyB1c2VyX25hbWUgOiBhZG1pbiB9Cg” is signed with the HS256 algorithm with the secret key “key”.

(Since the user does not have access to the secret key, she cannot sign the token herself.)', 'But if implemented incorrectly, there are ways that an attacker can bypass the security mechanism and forge arbitrary tokens.', 'One of the ways that attackers can forge their own tokens is by tampering with the alg field of the header. If the application does not restrict the algorithm type used in the JWT, an attacker can specify which algorithm to use, which could compromise the security of the token.', 'JWT supports a “none” algorithm. If the alg field is set to “none”, any token would be considered valid if their signature section is set to empty. For example, the following token would be considered valid:', 'eyAiYWxnIiA6ICJOb25lIiwgInR5cCIgOiAiSldUIiB9Cg.eyB1c2VyX25hbWUgOiBhZG1pbiB9Cg.', 'It is simply the base64url encoded versions of these two blobs, and no signature is present.', 'This feature was originally used for debugging purposes. But if not turned off in a production environment, it would allow attackers to forge any token they want by setting the alg field to “none”. They can then impersonate anyone on the site by using the forged tokens.', '2. HMAC algorithm', 'The two most common types of algorithms used for JWTs are HMAC and RSA. With HMAC, the token would be signed with a key, then later verified with the same key. As for RSA, the token would first be created with a private key, then verified with the corresponding public key.', 'It is critical that the secret key for HMAC tokens and the private key for RSA tokens are kept a secret since they are used to sign the tokens.', 'Now let’s say that there is an application that was originally designed to use RSA tokens. The tokens are signed with a private key A, which is kept a secret from the public. Then the tokens are verified with public key B, which is available to anyone. This is okay as long as the tokens are always treated as RSA tokens.', 'Now if the attacker changes the alg to HMAC, she might be able to create valid tokens by signing the forged tokens with the RSA public key B.', 'This is because originally when the token is signed with RSA, the program verifies it with the RSA public key B. When the signing algorithm is switched to HMAC, the token is still verified with the RSA public key B, but this time, the token can be signed with the same public key B (since it’s using HMAC).', 'It is also possible that the signature of the token is never verified after it arrives at the application. This way an attacker could simply bypass the security mechanism by providing an invalid signature.', 'It could also be possible to brute force the key used to sign a JWT.', 'The attacker has a lot of information to start with: she knows the algorithm used to sign the token, the payload that was signed and the resulting signature. If the key used to sign the token is not complex enough, she might be able to brute force it easily.', 'If an attacker is not able to brute force the key, she might try leaking the secret key instead. If another vulnerability (like a directory traversal, XXE, SSRF) exists that allows the attacker to read the file where the key value is stored, the attacker can steal the key and sign arbitrary tokens.', 'KID stands for “Key ID”. It is an optional header field in JWTs, and it allows developers to specify the key to be used for verifying the token. The proper usage of a KID parameter looks like this:', 'Since this field is controlled by the user, it can be manipulated by attackers and lead to dangerous consequences.', 'Since the KID is often used to retrieve a key file from the file system, if it is not sanitized before use, it can lead to a directory traversal attack. When this is the case, the attacker would be able to specify any file in the file system as the key to be used to verify the token.', 'For example, the attacker can force the application into using a publicly available file as the key, and sign an HMAC token using that file.', '2. SQL injection', 'The KID could also be used to retrieve the key from a database. In this case, it might be possible to utilize SQL injection to bypass JWT signing.', 'If SQL injection is possible on the KID parameter, the attacker can use this injection to return any value she wants.', 'For example, this above injection will cause the application to return the string “key” (since the key named “aaaaaaa” doesn’t exist in the database). The token will then be verified with the string “key” as the secret key.', 'In addition to a key ID, JSON web token standards also provide developers with the ability to specify keys via a URL.', 'JKU stands for “JWK Set URL”. It is an optional header field used to specify a URL that points to a set of keys that are used to verify the token. If this field is allowed and not properly restricted, an attacker could host their own key file and specify that the application uses it to verify tokens.', '2. JWK header parameter', 'The optional JWK (JSON Web Key) header parameter allows attackers to embed the key used to verify the token directly in the token.', '3. X5U, X5C URL manipulation', 'Similar to the jku and jwk headers, the x5u and x5c header parameters allow attackers to specify the public key certificate or certificate chain used to verify the token. x5u specifies the information in the URI form while x5c allows the certificate values to be embedded in the token.', 'There are also other JWT issues that arise when they are not correctly implemented. These are not very common, but definitely worth looking out for:', 'Information leak', 'Since JSON web tokens are used for access control, they often contain information about the user.', 'If the token is not encrypted, anyone can base64 decode the token and read the token’s payload. So if the token contains sensitive information, it might become a source of information leaks. A properly implemented signature section of the JSON web token provides data integrity, not confidentiality.', 'Command injection', 'Sometimes when the KID parameter is passed directly into an insecure file read operation, it is possible to inject commands into the code flow.', 'One of the functions that could allow this type of attack is the Ruby open() function. This function allows attackers to execute system commands by simply tacking the command onto the input after the KID file name:', 'This is just one example. Theoretically, vulnerabilities like this can happen whenever an application passes any of the header parameters unsanitized into any function resembling system(), exec(), etc.', 'Ultimately, JSON web tokens are just another form of user input. They should always be handled with skepticism and sanitized rigorously.', 'If you are interested in the topic or are working on a JWT related project, read about the current best practices here, and some secure implementations here!', 'Disclaimer: This post was written to bring attention to JSON Web Token vulnerabilities and help developers recognize common pitfalls.

I want to be clear that nobody knows precisely where the future of graphic design is heading. As a Creative Director and experienced designer, I only have my intuition and professional experience to guide my industry foresight. Graphic design is an incredibly tricky career because it frequently has to adapt to an ever-changing environment. New tools and skills are continuously being developed to adjust and navigate this complex progression. With these transformations taking place, I believe graphic design in the traditional sense is not as vital as it once was.', 'We can all acknowledge the fact that the internet has changed everything, including the role of graphic designers. Growing professions such as digital marketing, user interface design(UI), and user experience design (UX) have become essential components to successful design strategies. The question is, outside of the most fundamental design principles and proper branding, what role does graphic design play now?', 'The primary purpose of graphic design is to communicate ideas to an audience effectively using standard design principles. The goal may be to trigger someone to take action or expose them to an idea, concept, or information. Graphic design objectives happen through a combination of fundamental design practices, strategic composition, and a little creativity. Principles such as hierarchy, contrast, and proximity are some of the essential ingredients for a successful design.', 'Pre-internet graphic design utilized media such as direct mail, billboards, and print advertisements to achieve business goals. The conventional method for effectively reaching your target audience required a campaign or promotion to be visually impactful, easy to understand, and appropriately branded to grab attention and provide a benefit to the user and business. These simple tactics were one of the best strategies to reach objectives and compete against competitors successfully. The value of graphic design was apparent and essential for superior visual communication and reach.', 'In today’s modern era, the internet and mobile devices have changed everything. Gone are the days of needing visually compelling advertisements and appealing campaigns to achieve business goals. Instead, we can hit target audiences through advanced digital marketing and technology-related strategies. Techniques such as search engine marketing (SEM) and pay-per-click (PPC) have become standard practice for successful brands and campaigns. Digital marketing, combined with good content and UI/UX design, makes for some of the best user experiences imaginable. And let’s not forget to mention the invaluable data every user interaction produces — something print cannot provide.', 'An area that has exploded recently is “do-it-yourself” design, popularized by companies like Wix and Canva. These are businesses that provide pre-made templates of websites, social media ads, logos, and the list goes on. The value of a graphic designer is slowly being erased by turning what was once considered a unique personalized experience into a cookie-cutter service.', 'Of course, website templates and UI elements have to be created by graphic designers initially. The need to develop reusable system elements such as templates, buttons, and interfaces has significant importance in the development and execution of a project. This area is where core graphic design principles will shine.', 'If you think about it, graphic design is not much different from shoemaking.', 'There was a time when footwear was only available from experienced shoemakers. While some people still buy from those who have these skills, the majority of people do not choose this expensive option anymore. Instead, we opt for shoes from stores like Kohls, which have been created by manufacturers directed by a committee. Of course, a skilled shoemaker and footwear aficionados know the difference between a pair of $1000 custom hand made leather shoes and $50 Kohls specials designed for mass production. In this example, it’s not so much about quality and craftsmanship. It’s about what sells best and is suitable for business prosperity. The majority of companies are like people. They will invest in what makes sense if it appears good enough, or the return on investment is worth the high cost. While some businesses will only invest in custom made, the majority will opt for satisfactory and move on to what will increase business revenue and customer growth. If you think about it, graphic design is not much different from shoemaking.', 'I believe a companies brand voice and tone are more important than visual branding, especially with the online environment that currently exists. A brand voice that can successfully market across a multitude of platforms can be more potent than visual branding. This effectiveness is because you’re explicitly targeting users with messaging that resonates with them — no amount of graphics and fonts can manage this achievement. With the saturation of businesses on the internet, having the right voice produces incredible results and can make a company stand out.', 'Imagine you’re an established company, and you have to develop a new website to grow your business. Your options are website A, which spends 90% on content and marketing and 10% on design. Or website B, which spends 90% on design and 10% on content and marketing. Its possible website B may win a few awards for being a fantastic looking site and get credit where credit is due. However, the goal of graphic design is not about winning shiny awards or creating beautiful art (leave that to the illustrators). The harsh reality is website A would be the most effective at increasing customer growth and helping the company succeed.', 'I believe there’s a high probability graphic design will one day be a few classes offered as part of a marketing, web development, or UI/UX degree. The rate at which companies are embracing digital marketing and the exponential use of mobile devices is causing a massive shift in traditional business structures. If you include the slowing down of print media, it makes these predictions more convincing.', 'Not too long ago, graphic designers had to learn to be web designers to evolve in their industry. I believe including the areas of UI/UX design and digital marketing into one’s portfolio is critical for success. Understanding how invaluable these techniques are will enhance a graphic designer’s chances of survival and provide them with the skills for adaptation in an ever-changing landscape. It’s crucial to understand graphic designers have the talent and ability to succeed as long as they know their strengths and weaknesses and how they fit into the business world.', 'If you liked this article, check out some of my others at Medium.com/@micbuckcreative']

Dopamine Fasting 2.0 is an evidence-based technique to manage addictive behaviors, by restricting them to specific periods of time, and practicing fasting from impulsively engaging in them, in order to regain behavioral flexibility.

If you’ve ever studied behaviorism in a psychology course, you may recall that “classical conditioning” is a process which helps us learn that involves dopamine. To be clear, we ARE NOT fasting from dopamine itself, but from impulsive behaviors reinforced by it.', 'With enough training, unconditioned stimuli we’ve never seen before, like a red dot or notification on your smartphone, can become conditioned stimuli, because we learn to anticipate a reward (the negative reinforcement of alleviating our negative emotions, or the positive reinforcement of seeing a novel thing). This ‘double reinforcement’ can lead to impulsive/addictive behavior since every time we feel bored, anxious, angry, sad or lonely, we seek those things that both numb the bad feeling and distract our attention with pleasure.', 'We can regain flexibility over such automatic, rigid behavior by restricting the external stimuli, which is a Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)-based technique called “stimulus control.” You can do this in several ways to reduce your need to rely on willpower:', '1) Put the stimulus (like your phone) away or make it harder to access.', '2) Engage in an alternative activity that is incompatible with the stimulus (e.g. hard to do sports and stress eat at the same time)', '3) Use website-blocking software or social accountability to prevent yourself from cheating.', 'We can also naturally expose ourselves to the internal stimuli (negative emotions), without engaging in the conditioned response (grabbing for our phone), which is another CBT-based technique called “exposure and response prevention”.', '1) Notice when the impulses arise, and what thoughts and feelings you’re experiencing in that moment.', '2) Practice “urge surfing”: watch the desire to engage in the conditioned response come and go without giving into it.', '3) Repeatedly returning to whatever you are doing on instead, with a spirit of non-judgement.', 'Over time, this weakens the classical conditioning in a process called ‘habituation’, which ultimately restores our behavioral flexibility.', 'Collectively, CBT is considered the gold standard treatment for impulse control disorders. With behaviors that are hard to abstain from altogether, the scientific consensus is that', '“clinicians have generally agreed that moderated and controlled use of the Internet is most appropriate to treat the problem.”', 'In addition, a specific study showed that dopamine fasting from Facebook for a week helped students regain 13.3 hours of their time, and significantly reduced depressive symptoms by 17%, which allowed them to engage in more healthy behaviors instead.', 'What makes Dopamine Fasting 2.0 unique are the time blocks, which recommends fasting for gradually longer periods of time periodically to extend the benefits.

If it’s easier to start by dopamine fasting for 1 hour a day (vs. 4 hours a day), then go for it, and then try to ramp up to what you’re willing to do and sustain long-term (e.g. 2 hours/day).

They use both and fasting and feasting schedules: having video game makers program a feature that disallows use from 10PM-8AM, and only allowing use for 1.5 hours/day during weekdays and 3 hours/day during weekends and holidays.

What differentiates Dopamine Fasting 2.0 is that I DO NOT prescribe a list of things that you cannot do.

Thus, I’d suggest it’s fine to have sex if you can’t do it another time and it’s done in a fulfilling way with a regular partner. Americans are generally starved of physical intimacy, so values-aligned sex is a healthy behavior worth making an exception for (just when I’m treating insomnia, I tell clients that sex is the only activity allowed in bed besides sleep, to promote sleep hygiene).

That helps reinforce the lesson that these behaviors aren’t inherently problematic, but it’s the habit that’s the issue. So practice flexibility regarding fasting itself in order to reset from resetting.']

Those who decide what crowds consume create.', 'You might as well carry on with the bottomless finger-scrolling and continue to devour what the elite class has created for you today.', 'But if you ever intend to define what crowds consume, and thereby define the marketplace, you have to master the ability to stay away from the crowds and move over to the creators’ side.', 'That’s where the elite production happens. And it requires long, uninterrupted hours of work in intense concentration.', 'I wrote down the above notes in my journal in 2016. It was soon after being hugely inspired by Adam Grant’s story, which I had read in Cal Newport’s popular book, Deep Work.', 'In 2014, Adam Grant’s ability to create at an absurdly high rate for his field made him the youngest full professor at Wharton. It wasn’t only starring at one of the world’s best business schools nor the unusually high number of papers he was publishing in major journals, but also his ability to write one massive bestselling book after another.', 'As Cal Newport later found out, none of those achievements were random: Grant was indeed obsessed with the mechanics of producing at an elite level — a level where you produce not only quality work but also deliver it at a wildly high pace.', 'He saw productivity as a scientific problem to systematically solve. And one idea seemed central to his solution:', 'The batching of hard but important intellectual work into long, uninterrupted stretches.', 'According to Newport, those stretches enabled Grant to achieve a deep state of focus like no other — working for extended periods free from distraction with full concentration on a single task unlocked peak productivity.', 'Back in those days, I couldn’t even sit still on my chair for a few minutes, never mind keeping my attention long enough to get my monkey mind to focus on a single task. As I mentioned in a 2015 essay, I wasn’t doing the thing, but I did everything else in order to postpone doing the thing.', 'Between bottomless Instagram scrolling and trying to do at least some work here and there, I was spending my entire days staring at a screen. Yet when I got home in the evening, I felt exhausted and nervous. And guilty. Guilty of not having achieved anything.', 'Punishing myself with more work or promising to make a fresh start the next morning didn’t work. New beginnings weren’t any different — they required concentration, too. That’s when my brain chose to run for the next exit. Hopping on to the next stimulus it bumped into felt good. Facing the actual work meant mental effort instead.', 'French mathematician Blaise Pascal was right:', 'All of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.', 'But success in most creative endeavors requires the exact opposite: to sit and think. Take the field of writing. To write is to think. To write well is to think well.', 'And the trouble with our monkey minds begins right there, in our inability to sit alone with our thoughts.', 'We can’t stay away from those who consume because we can’t tolerate boredom.', 'We dread the silence of our very existence so we choose aimless distraction.', 'In author Zat Rana’s beautiful words, the issue at the root isn’t our obsession with any particular worldly stimulation. It’s the fear of nothingness — our addiction to a state of not-being-bored:', '“At its core, it’s not necessarily that we are addicted to a TV set because there is something uniquely satisfying about it, just like we are not addicted to most stimulants because the benefits outweigh the downsides.', 'Rather, what we are really addicted to is a state of not-being-bored. Almost anything else that controls our life in an unhealthy way finds its root in our realization that we dread the nothingness of nothing.', 'We can’t imagine just being rather than doing. And therefore, we look for entertainment, we seek company, and if those fail, we chase even higher highs.”', 'Coming to such a realization can be life-changing. For me, identifying the root of my attention problem marked one of the most crucial turning points in my journey.', 'If I can teach myself to choose boredom over aimless distraction, I thought to myself, I can fix my attention problem.', 'If I wanted to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task, I had to learn a new skill:', 'The ability to sit alone with my thoughts and bear the unbearable boredom it brings.', 'What I didn’t know, however, was how much effort it would take.', 'On October 12th last month, I recorded one of my longest sessions in full concentration. I started working at 8:10 a.m. and finished my morning flow at 12:57 p.m.', 'That was 4 hours 47 minutes of effortless, uninterrupted deep work without needing to take a single break.', 'During this morning session, I wrote one of my most popular articles. I was also able to approve two client deliverables our editors had asked me to review.', 'Over the last few years, the length of those focused stretches has been slowly going up; these days, they’re averaging around four hours.', 'Timing my focused sessions isn’t to show off or fool myself with a vanity metric, nor is it to adapt yet another Silicon Valley productivity trend. But it is part of a system I have learned to follow religiously since 2016.', 'And if you can forgive me for the use of too many self-important “I”s or “my”s in this essay, I want to share my system with you — a system that gradually took me from not being able to sit still on my chair for even 15 minutes to effortlessly working in hours-long, deeply focused stretches.', 'I run a storytelling studio and a publication where my work requires me to mentally process large amounts of text on a daily basis.', 'And the batching of work into long, uninterrupted stretches has been a gamechanger for delivering high-quality intellectual work and signing some of today’s top startups as clients in an overly crowded content industry.', 'Reading this post or self-help books may feel useful.

You’ve completed reading the first four minutes so far. Finishing the rest in one sitting will be effortless for some of you. But others won’t even get close to staying focused enough to continue reading for the next 10 minutes. To do that, they will need to force themselves to not open another browser tab or grab their mobile phones.', 'Understanding the fundamentals of uninterrupted work requires understanding that very exact effortless focus which sits on the thin line between loose focus (one that risks losing it to distractions at any second) and forced focus (one that eats up your limited mental stock).', 'The effortless focus is the sweet spot. It’s the ultimate mental balance we are looking to reach by mastering our minds.', 'And this guide proposes a pragmatic approach to achieve just that — it advocates the idea that the mind is a tool whose muscles can be trained. Drawing upon my 47 months of experience and other examples, it shares a roadmap for how to get your mind to work for you, not against you.', 'Please note that what works for others might not work for you, so try taking away only what applies to your case.', 'The rest of the post consists of two sections. While the first section below focuses on the practicalities of mind training and strengthening the attention muscles, the second part will dig into the specifics of logging long, uninterrupted sessions of focused work.', 'I’ve written 1,345 words up to this point. I got stuck on one of the paragraphs you just read above so I had to take a quick break to walk out on the terrace. But other than that, I’ve been in an uninterrupted flow for about 187 minutes since 7:50 a.m.', 'It still amazes me to see how on earth I am able to stay focused for so many hours without being bored. And every time I watch people who can’t even walk without staring at their phones, I remember my old monkey-mind days.', 'I owe this dramatic transition to the one and only daily mind-training practice.', 'Whatever controls your attention controls what you are capable of. And taming your brain puts that control back in your hands. Borrowing philosopher William James’s words, it empowers you with today’s greatest weapon: the ability to choose one thought over another.', 'And building an ability to choose boredom over aimless distraction begins with awareness — awareness of our inability to sit alone with our thoughts.', 'But awareness doesn’t last — you have to work at it. You need to train your brain, whether every day or every week, to catch yourself every time your monkey mind drifts off and becomes a slave to the aimless stimuli.', 'You need a consistent practice to bring your wandering mind back to the task at hand — to the boredom.', 'And if you stick with your practice long enough, the whole catch-and-bring-back process becomes effortless.', 'Before we talk about how and what tools you can use to tame your mind, let’s take a quick look at the purpose behind it all.', 'Terms like “mind training,” “self-reflection practice,” or “mindfulness” can easily sound philosophical or vague. And it’s important to understand that what we are talking about here isn’t a mystical activity.', 'What matters instead is understanding the true purpose behind it all — which is all about spending time undistracted and alone, in self-examination.', 'In very simple words, it’s about:', 'How you do one thing in life is how you do everything. Over time, you automatically start bringing such self-reflection into your day-to-day life. You start catching and observing yourself outside your 10-minute daily practice.', 'For instance, if you are distracted by a loud person in the office, you notice it, label it as “just noise” and return back to your focused work without getting caught up in it.', 'In my case, my job often involves staring at a blank page. And staring at a blank page requires embracing the unbearable nothingness of that screen. After 41 months of daily meditation (more on that in a minute), I’m able to catch myself almost every time my monkey mind drifts off and bring it back to the boring empty screen in front of me.', 'What has impressed me the most with my daily practice is how, over time, it has also drastically reduced the number of times my mind drifts off.', 'You don’t need any fancy tools to get great results. All you need is to make time regularly, whether every day or every week, undistracted and alone, in self-reflection mode.', 'A pen and paper will do it. Some people follow a daily journaling practice, while others prefer retreats, walks in nature or other self-reflection methods.', 'What worked best for me has been meditation — what I once thought was a mystical activity has changed my life forever.', 'Today, there are hundreds of meditation apps on the app stores. Calm and Headspace are popular. For instance, Calm’s 30-day “How to Mediate” program with Jeff Warren is impressive. I first began with the “7 Days of Calm” program and then moved on to the “21 Days of Calm” — both are great for beginners and cover all the fundamentals.', 'But again, Headspace and all other apps offer similar programs so I recommend trying some and seeing what works best for you.', 'One of the reasons those meditation apps are so powerful is because they are guided. Run by capable instructors, those 10-minute sessions make you realize things that would take you months to acknowledge in a self-taught session.', 'Training the attention muscles is a long game — reaching a level where you naturally catch your distractions outside your 10-minute sessions takes some time.', 'But to give some examples from my personal experience, I began meditating daily in July 2016. It took me around two months just to get comfortable with sitting down alone with my thoughts.', 'In the early days, it was shocking to see how my mind was able to wander off so often during the sessions, never mind applying it to my day-to-day life.', 'But as I kept taking it seriously and making time to sit down with my practice, between three to six months, I began understanding what those instructors meant — that boredom really did provide its own stimulation; that I didn’t need another stimulus and could just sit and get curious about the present moment.', 'These days, I don’t even need to open my meditation app as I can practice self-reflection right at my desk or during my commute to work.', 'I still have hectic days where my mind is completely on fire and I fail at being mindful. But the goal isn’t to get lost in the rabbit hole of personal development, nor are we trying to become productivity gurus — welcoming a hectic day without any judgment is part of the practice itself.', 'Indeed, over time, you understand that there is no goal at all and this is a lifelong journey to learning to focus on the only thing that matters: the present moment.', 'And not surprisingly, the present moment is also where you have to do the focused work — it’s where the blank page stands in front of you.', 'While the mind-taming practice does its magic in the background, you can start tracking your progress from day one.', 'This tracking involves writing down each uninterrupted session you are able to work in full concentration.', 'Mark down when you start, and when you finish. The goal is to gradually improve your ability to record longer, deeper sessions.', 'Here’s what my daily tracking looks like:', 'Every time I need to take a quick break or feel my concentration is getting loose, I close the session and write down the final minute where my session ends.', 'I recommend not setting ambitious goals at the beginning — in the early weeks, my sessions used to average around only 20–30 minutes.', 'The routine of logging my sessions helps me to track the progress of what I love to call a “myelin-building exercise.” When the journalist Daniel Coyle surveyed a group of neuroscientists for his book The Talent Code, he had little idea what he was about to uncover.', 'These scientists argued that people’s performance at hard tasks improved as they developed more myelin (a layer of fatty tissue) around the relevant neurons, allowing the corresponding circuit to fire more effortlessly and effectively.', 'As Cal Newport also reflected on Coyle’s findings, to be great at intense concentration was to be well myelinated:', '“By focusing intensely on a specific skill, you’re forcing the relevant circuit to fire, again and again, in isolation. This repetitive use of a specific circuit triggers cells called oligodendrocytes to begin wrapping layers of myelin around the neurons in the circuits.', 'The reason, therefore, why it’s important to focus intensely on the task at hand while avoiding distraction is because this is the only way to isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination.”', 'By contrast, if you work in a state of loose concentration (e.g., you have another tab open), you fire too many circuits simultaneously and as a result fail at isolating the neurons you actually want to strengthen.', 'Whether the myelin science has any actual merit to it, it’s still impressive to see how the mind adapts and gets better at logging longer sessions over time.', 'And after two years of tracking my sessions, I’ve found that faster progress depends heavily on two things: 1) protecting your time, and 2) decluttering your system.', 'Let’s finish this guide by taking a quick look at both:', 'With over $87 billion to his name, there is one thing Warren Buffett can’t purchase: time.', '“I can buy anything I want, basically, but I can’t buy time,” shares the 88-year-old billionaire in a 2017 conversation with Bill Gates.', 'Time is really the most precious thing there is. Yet we split it up and give it away like there’s an endless supply.', 'Probably the most impactful thing I’ve done that has improved my ability to log deeper sessions was to introduce untouchable hours to my work system.', 'These are the hours where I protect my most precious asset; the hours where even the closest people in my life have a hard time reaching me. It’s when even my phone can’t get past the door of the room I’m working in — the rest of the world can wait.', '“Focus isn’t a willpower effort one does in the midst of distractions; it’s the act of removing distractions and effortlessly doing what’s left.” — Luca Dellanna', 'As the name suggests, these are your untouchable hours. You need to guard them. Hoard them. Protect them. And don’t let any potential distraction touch them.', 'To ruthlessly protect your untouchable hours, arm yourself with powerful tools that are available to masses today. For instance, a free tool like Mailbrew helps you receive all the tweets or newsletters you don’t want to miss in your inbox at a time YOU decide. Similarly, you can also use the Freedom App to block distracting websites and apps (such as social media) for specific periods of the day.', 'Whether you’re a morning person or a night owl, everyone has different peak hours.', 'I highly recommend finding your internal prime time, which is the time of day, according to your body clock, when you are most alert and productive.', 'My prime time is from 7 a.m. to around 12:30 p.m. I figured out that my energy drops significantly in the second part of the day so I get my deep work done before lunchtime. And I handle all the other teamwork, operational or admin stuff in the afternoons.', 'You don’t always have the luxury to choose, though. Some people have day jobs and their untouchable hours for their side projects happen in the early morning before everyone else wakes up. Others have kids and can lock down untouchable time for themselves only after the little ones go to bed.', '“A busy calendar and a busy mind will destroy your ability to create anything great. You should be too busy to do coffee while keeping an uncluttered calendar.”', '— Naval Ravikant', 'Setting aside untouchable hours doesn’t mean you should flood the rest of your day with things to do.', 'To log longer, deeper sessions, you’ll also need to use your energy wisely outside your untouchable hours. You’ll need a calm mind and a calendar that’s as empty as possible.', 'When the host Charlie Rose asks Bill Gates what he has learned from Warren Buffett, Gates points to Buffett’s almost entirely empty calendar. “There’s nothing on it,” he says.', 'And reflecting on how Buffett taught him to declutter his agenda, he adds: “You know, I had every minute packed and I thought that was the only way you could do things.”', 'One of the things I’ve learned on this front is that the best way to get things done is to have fewer things to do. And having fewer things to do has a lot to do with your ability to say NO.', 'Taking time away from a busy to-do list gives you all the time and energy to sit and think.', 'You might as well carry on with the bottomless finger-scrolling and continue to consume what the elite class has created for you today. Or you might choose to stay away from the crowds and move over to the creators’ side.', 'Observing the elite class’s obsession with producing at an elite level is a wake-up call for all of us to finally get serious about learning to sit alone with our thoughts.', 'Whatever controls our attention controls what we are capable of. And taking that control back in our hands begins by training our brains to embrace the boredom that comes with hours-long work in full concentration.', 'Choosing boredom over aimless stimuli is choosing the silence of our very existence. After all, we learn from the silences, not from what makes the most noise on the surface.', 'Once we cross that initial barrier, we realize boredom really does provide its own stimuli. We begin getting curious about the present moment.', 'And not surprisingly, the present is also where we have to do the focused work — it’s where the blank page stands in front of us.', 'Welcome to the creators’ club.']

It has a 1:n relationship with Artist model.', 'And finally our Artist.cs model', 'Now that we defined our models we can implement our repositories with the repository pattern', 'The Repository pattern, in simple words, is encapsulating your database operations (ORM or other methods of database access) in one place. Basically abstracting your data access layer. This has many advantages, such as:', 'A Unit of work is responsible for keeping track of the list of changes during a transaction and committing it.', 'Even though Entity Framework internally implements the repository pattern and unit of work pattern, it is a good practice to implement ourselves the repository to decouple our project from Entity Framework. This way we are not strongly bound to it and if we want to switch from this Entity Framework version to another or to another ORM framework, we require much less work to do so. Also it helps when mocking stuff for testing.', 'First we create a Repositories folder and add a IRepository.cs interface, which will be our base repository with basic database operations.', 'Now the other two repositories:', 'For last our Unit of Work interface:', 'Services will be the center of our business logic, the link between our API and our Data.', 'First we create a folder to house our services interfaces, the Services folder.', 'Then create two services interfaces, IMusicService.cs, to handle music logic, and IArtistService.cs, to handle artist logics.', 'The Core project will hold all our application business logic structure, everything that should tell how it should work.

I helped my brothers weigh a few kilos of hashish on a brass set of scales designed for the purpose of weighing illegal substances for the onward sale to willing buyers.', 'I was 14 years old at the time. My eldest brother 18, my middle brother 16.', 'We are surrounded by their friends at the kitchen table. They are red-eyed, and stupefied — their bodies polluted by too many grams of hash and other class A narcotics et al.', 'This military process — the weighing of drugs — takes place the morning after a house party we have hosted to what seems like the entire dysfunctional youth of our village. Mum and Dad were somewhere abroad, Dubai I think.', 'Unbeknownst to my parents, our house last night turned into a venue for what could only be described as a rave, drug fest and gang bang all in one.', 'The living room was transformed into a DJ shack — decks and speakers adorned the room, and stoned and drugged people limp, swaying in their drug-induced fugues. Depending on their drug of choice, some had the energy to raise arms in the air, lit lighters propping up the ceiling. Others lay comatose on the carpet, chairs, draped over sofa’s, saliva making its way out of the corner of mouths in accordance with the force of gravity.', 'In the kitchen, zombies were emptying cupboards, searching for fuel, desperate to fill their bellies in deranged substance-generated hysteria. The following morning, our kitchen was scant of any food — drugged hyenas had rinsed our cupboards dry.', 'Out in the garden people were having sex, the Wendy house had turned into a metaphorical whore’s den. I go upstairs and discover that the stairs to the loft are down — I could smell the hash emanating from downstairs in the kitchen.', 'As I ascend I am anxious as to what I will find. My two elder brothers have hauled their bed mattresses up to the loft — how I don’t know, but somehow they squeezed them through the tiny loft hatch where about 12 teenagers were polluting their bodies with all manner of class A drugs; Ketamine, Cocaine, MDMA, LSD and who knows what else. Bodies strewn across the muddy mattresses; some looking frankly, like corpses.', 'Bongs, spoons and straws litter the floor, and foil is everywhere, flickers of light bouncing off their shiny side and creating dimples of disco-ball type reflections on the apex of the loft. Faces droop with the paralysis of the drugs in their bodies — the lights are on, but not one soul is at home.', 'The pikeys from down the road are in our house. I don’t know why my brothers have permitted their entry into our personal space. We discover the next day that they have stolen all manner of our parents prized possessions, and no surprise, they have smashed all the windows in my brothers and mothers car and stolen the headunit stereo that my brother had saved up so long for.', 'I don’t feel sympathy for his loss, I think he is stupid and that he deserves it.', 'I hate the arrogance of how he dishes out instructions for cleaning up the house that is now scarred by the events of last night. Bongs, foil, spliffs, tobacco, baggies, cocaine, cocaine snorting devices; the chaos and filth of it all is contaminating my home and it fills me with deep unease and shame. The carpets, my parents furniture are pocked with cigarette stub marks — holes that can never be filled in. Permanent reminders of this night that I will never forget.', 'The place is trashed and our parents will be home within the next 24 hours. I wonder how my brother can be so confident that they won’t find out.', 'Back to the weighing.', 'We are weighing the drugs at the kitchen table, for my eldest brother — the big-time drug dealer, to sell. To pollute others bodies, to maim and ruin. There’s a conveyor belt arrangement, between him, me, my psychologically vulnerable middle brother, and a few other friends who are still completely fucked from last night.', 'Military precision.', 'In between bagging the drugs, my eldest brother smokes one spliff after another — the distinctive odour of hashish filling my lungs and inducing irritating giggles from friends round the table.', 'I look at my middle brother, and he is heavily dissociated. His eyes are vacant, devoid of life. Staring straight ahead, at nothing whatsoever.', 'Years after this day, I realise that this was the start of his spiral into schizophrenia. The fluctuations between his anxious and paranoid body movements, and his catatonic state were markers of the early manifestations of the psychotic disorder that would later rob him of his teens, twenties and well into his thirties.', 'It is my eldest brother I hate for this. He didn’t protect either of us, our big brother — the big shot drug dealer.', 'After this event, many nights a week for months on end, a dark voice would call our house and at the end of the phone the voice would tell me that he was going to come and rape my Mother and I. These people my brother owed money to, people that wanted his head. This was well after my brother had left our home and was living it up at University; his wild life funded by his drug dealing.', 'Before long my middle brother had experienced various psychotic breaks. He had fully and completely disconnected from sanity and was well into the throws of schizophrenia.', 'One day I am sitting at the kitchen table, working at something on the computer. My brother, or the person that looks like him but no longer possesses his once beautiful soul, walks into the kitchen. There is a towel only, to cover up his body, which now resembles that of a skeleton. He is literally a bag of bones, and his face is ashen white. His cheekbones would cut the flesh of a tomato.', 'He leans against the kitchen fridge and lights a cigarette. I know better these days than to make eye-contact with him. The voices in his head interpret eye-contact as threat, and launch my brother into some sort of crazed Ninja.', 'From the corner of my eye I can feel his are on me — staring.', 'The voices in his head are trying to rouse something, anything from me, to give them cause to attack. “Do you want some toast?” I ask my brother. I look up to see the familiar flicker of transition on his face. Transition from my brother to the persona that is the voice in his mind.', '“I’m sorry?” he says with a furrowed, angry brow.', '“Do you want toast, I am going to make some?”.', '“What the fuck did you just say Amelie?”, he approaches me and my body’s thermostat explodes, I am at once burning with heat — fear of what might be about to unfold.', 'I can feel my form start to reduce itself into the chair, I make myself smaller, this is not a conscious endeavor but I think an unconscious one to convince him that there is nothing to fear, I am not a threat.', 'He brings the cigarette between his thumb and index finger and raises it above my head as though to indicate that my forehead is about to become an ashtray. “Harry”, I muster, my palms out in front of me, facing outwards, “Harry, I was just seeing if you are hungry, that’s all, I’m sorry”, my eyes are closed and my body has tensed itself fully. “I’m sorry, I am sorry Harry”.', 'I can feel and hear his body bend, and his breath is on my face — there is silence, and then he slaps me. The shock of it freezes my body, accentuating the sting and heat now pulsating in my cheek. “You fucking bitch Amelie.” He leaves the kitchen, taking his cigarette with him. When were we allowed to smoke in the house I wonder. But there are no rules for Harry, only his own. I sob quietly.', 'In the next few years many of my brother’s friends die from overdose. They had graduated quickly from hash into other harder drugs. Too young to moderate or temper their consumption they didn’t know how much to take and so their lives terminated abruptly: prematurely. And it was abundantly clear that this same trajectory would be the fate for my brother if something didn’t change.', 'I elected to attend all the parties that he did — so that I could observe what drugs he was taking; who he was hanging around with. He was a shadow of his former self. And his friends of choice were seriously nasty people.', 'Before long his schizophrenia had transformed him into a person I no longer knew. He was perpetually paranoid; afraid; aggressive; hyper vigilant for threat. The edge of innocence was gone, and his kind, sensitive spirit had evaporated into thin air.', 'We would stand in a queue in a pub and within minutes he would have rammed his first into the faces of several innocent bystanders that he believed were ‘out to get me’. He pushed over a pregnant woman while walking down the street one day believing she was staring at him.', 'He stole hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of goods to fund his addiction to hash.', 'Eventually he was homeless — unable to hold down a job and forever in and out of courts defending his entirely defenseless and unforgivable behaviour.', 'When I used to visit my homeless brother from living abroad he looked like a madman. He had a beard that aged him 20 years, it was peppered with bits of the forrest, food, and god knows what else. His eyes were wide open as though propped agape with toothpicks — all the wider so that he could view his surroundings by 360 degrees lest somebody happened to be staring at him or ‘out to get’ him. It was deeply tragic.', 'The saddest bit of all is that the police, the courts had no sympathy for this mental affliction. They saw a nutter who was a threat to civilians on the street. They weren’t wrong. But what they didn’t realise, nor care for, was that he was mentally ill and so desperately needed help.', 'Deep in my brothers eyes was a sadness and vulnerability that literally shattered my heart. He was suffering so greatly. I wanted to take all of this away from him — him living in the forest, eating scraps of food from people’s bins while they slept. But in moments of lucidity his selfless self assured me that he was just fine — this broke my heart even more. He was so far from fine, I could smell death around the corner.', 'I remember being at work one day — him in the UK, me in Asia and he is crying down the phone — he doesn’t want to live anymore. He cannot cope with the voices in his head — finally they are going to kill him. He talks of religion for hours on end — the church he visited yesterday, its history and its beauty. He has found peace with God and he is going to leave this earth for a more peaceful place where the voices can no longer haunt him. I sit in my workplace toilet on the floor and sob my heart out — begging my brother to seek help immediately. I am helpless.', 'It wasn’t until some well-meaning general practitioner met with Harry and took pity on him. Finally a human-being recognised that he was mentally ill and got my brother onto schizophrenic medication. He will take this for the rest of his life.', 'Today my brother is psychologically, emotionally and cognitively stunted. He lost the crucial developmental years of his adolescence and as such is probably the mental age of about 20, maybe younger. He is nearly 37. He now lives in a studio flat on his own, has held down a job for four years and even drives a car. He looks like he is 45, and he has a vulnerability that moves my heart to its breaking point. He is kind and sweet, loving and thoughtful. But he is also manipulative and cunning and will swindle us all when he wants something — the skills he learned when he had to fight at any cost to feed his addiction.', 'But I am grateful, he didn’t leave this world along with his poor friends who abandoned us prematurely many moons ago. He is here, albeit in a form that is not what nature intended for him.', 'There is a place for Cannabis in our world, no doubt. It has been clinically proven time and again that it has medicinal qualities that alleviate myriad ailments. But when it comes to the various strains of Cannabis that have become street-drug of choice I immediately go stiff with anxiety.,', 'I cringe when I hear people deny the link between hashish and schizophrenia — my prickles go up. I want to shout to the rooftops that they are wrong. I’m not saying Cannabis or its damaging strain hashish will cause schizophrenia in every abuser — but it will for those with a predisposition to do so.', 'I have no doubt that my generation will yield a host of case studies that will prove the point and I pray that the substance becomes entirely illegal or we will lose so many more people to this chaotic drug — through overdose of harder drugs because they graduated from hashish; suicide, and through behaviour driven by the madness of schizophrenia that ends in foreshortened life.', 'In the meantime my only hope is that our mental healthcare systems can take this issue seriously, educate our children on the potential ramifications of Cannabis abuse — schizophrenia is a cruel cruel mental disorder that nobody deserves to suffer from.']

For instance, when you try to close Microsoft Word without saving, it shows a dialog where you choose to resume your work (the “Cancel” option) or close the program (by either saving or not saving your work). The modal dialog appears because you can’t continue using Word as long as you don’t choose one of the options available. Until then, you can only stare at the dialog.', 'But let’s look at another example: a logout operation. Say, the user clicks the logout button in your application but, instead of logging them out right away, you want to confirm that’s what the user is trying to do. After all, they might have clicked the button by mistake. Incidentally, that is what I will be showing you today, how to create a logout modal dialog component in Angular (8). Once the user clicks the logout button, a modal pops up with only two options for the user: “Logout”, which confirms the user’s intention, and “Go back”, which closes the modal and returns the user to the normal use of the application.', 'Before we get into the code, I want to preface it by clarifying that this article is written under the assumption that you are already familiar with Angular. The resulting application itself is very simple so if you have a basic understanding of the framework you should be fine. To use the modal we will only need two things: to create a button in the root component (app-root) and create a new component, which will be the modal itself.', 'First up, we need to create a new Angular project through the command line:', 'The first command creates a new project called modal-component. When prompted for routing, you can choose whatever you prefer as it doesn’t affect this example. For the stylesheet format, choose CSS. The second command moves us inside the folder created for the project. The third command, code ., is a handy shortcut to open Visual Studio Code in the current working directory, that is, the project’s folder. This is just a nice shortcut if you’re using Visual Studio Code as your editor.', 'Now that we have our project open in the code editor, there’s one thing we need to install in the project: Angular Material. If you’re not familiar, it includes a bunch of pre-made components ready to be added to a project. In this example, we’ll be making use of its MatButton for, you guessed it, the buttons and MatDialog to create the modal dialog.', 'So, to install the library, return to the command line and enter', 'ng add @angular/material', 'While installing Material, you will be prompted for three questions: theme, set up of HammerJS and set up of Material animations. You can choose whichever theme you prefer as it doesn’t impact our functionality, but please choose to set Material animations or it will break the application. For HammerJS, don’t set it up. If you have any doubts regarding the installation of Angular Material, please refer to the official Getting Started page.', 'Now that Angular Material is set, we just need to do one last thing that’s not actual code: create the modal component. I mean, not the finished version of course, but the component which will be the modal. For that, enter', 'ng generate component modal', 'in the command line. And so this command creates a new component in the application called modal (or rather, app-modal). Now we can finally start writing code!', 'The first thing we’ll do is add a new key the @NgModule in theapp.module.ts file, as well as some imports, as shown in the following code gist:', 'According to the documentation, this is the purpose of entryComponents: “The set of components to compile when this NgModule is defined, so that they can be dynamically loaded into the view”. In practice, if this was not set, then the MatDialog would not be loaded properly (in our case the MatDialog will make use of ModalComponent, the component we created earlier). For the imports, well, we need to import the Angular Material modules we will be using.', 'Now that all the setup is out of the we can finally focus on writing HTML, CSS and TypeScript. Oh and by the way, you can run the project by entering', 'ng serve --open', 'in the command line. This opens the project in your browser and will rebuild the project whenever you modify it, so you can check it out throughout the article to see how it changes.', 'Before touching any component, let’s set the global styles right away in the styles.css file:', 'For now focus only on the changes to the html and body elements, we’ll come back to the mat-dialog-container#modal-component ruleset later.', 'With the global styles defined, we can move on to the individual components. Let’s start with the app-root component, the “home page” of the application, which will look like this:', 'That’s it, just a lonely logout button in the center of the screen. Clicking it will trigger the logout modal component, that is, before actually logging out the user, we first ask them for confirmation. To reiterate, when the modal appears, the user can either confirm the logout or return to the application.', 'So, let’s start with the HTML:', 'As you can see, it’s simple. A main element holds the whole component, which contains just one other element: the logout button. But due notice the mat-raised-button attribute. That’s what transforms the normal HTML button into an Angular Material button, including its associated styles and animations. Though, we also give it an idto alter slightly its styles:', 'Pretty simple as well, with only the text color, background color and borders of the button changed. Nothing else regarding the CSS for app-root. Now there’s one last thing we need to change for this component: its TypeScript. Our objective is to create the function which is called when the logout button is clicked. And what does the function actually do? Open the modal component, that is, a MatDialog:', 'Ok, now let me explain what happens in this file. First notice that there are three new imports: MatDialog and MatDialogConfig(both from Angular Material) and ModalComponent, the class of the component we have created. In the class constructor of app-root, we inject a dependency: the MatDialog which we have been talking about since the beginning. If we didn’t inject it, then we wouldn’t be able to open a dialog.', 'Then, we do two things inside the openModal() function: configure the dialog to be opened with a MatDialogConfig object and actually open the modal. We make use of four configuration options:', 'In the last line of the function, we open the modal dialog by calling the open() method of the MatDialog object injected in the constructor. To open a dialog, we need to specify which will be the component rendered inside along with a corresponding configuration object.', 'And that’s it for the app-root component, now when you click the logout button it will open an empty modal dialog!', 'Now we need to look at the app-modal component, the component we created. Again, we’ll need to change its HTML, CSS and TypeScript, but first, let me show you what the modal will look like in the end:', 'Again, we are starting with the HTML:', 'We have a single div element that wraps all the content of the modal, and then that content is separated in three parts:', 'Fairly simple stuff as well, and notice how we’ve used MatButtons once again for the modal.', 'Now, the CSS has a trick behind it because of Angular Material.', 'What is shown above is fairly straightforward CSS. In the first ruleset (#modal-content-wrapper) we transform the dialog into a three-row grid, one row for each of the parts enumerated. The remaining rulesets are used just for positioning and minor style adjustments (note: if you’re unfamiliar with the CSS grid layout, I have written an introductory article here in case you are interested).', 'What is tricky about the modal’s CSS is styling theMatDialog Angular Material component. If you look at the stylesheet above, there’s no ruleset for the design of the dialog itself. modal-content-wrapper is the id of the HTML element that wraps all of the content inside the modal, not the actual modal.', 'Enter the MatDialog configuration object. Remember when we wrote the configurations for the dialog to be opened in app-root? We passed it a custom id, modal-component, which we can now use to style the dialog. But we can’t do that in the CSS of app-modal as that is in fact the content of the dialog, not the dialog itself. Hence that ruleset I asked you to ignore back in styles.css. While this file contains the global CSS rulesets, we have no other choice but to set the styles for this particular MatDialog here.', 'Unlike the buttons that are “transformed” into MatButtons by adding the mat-raised-button attribute, which still allow us to modify the button’s styles in the CSS of the components where they are used, the dialog works differently as it is almost in a limbo between app-root (where it is opened) and app-modal (the component it contains). In short, we style the MatDialog in the global styles.css file because we can’t access it in neither of the other component’s stylesheets.', 'But, as we are dealing with global styles, we need to be careful with the specificity of our ruleset so it doesn’t affect other dialogs we might have in the application. Thus, let’s look at the styles.css code gist once again.', 'Look at the last ruleset, that’s the one responsible for the styles of our MatDialog. We use a CSS selector of tag name (mat-dialog-container), which catches any MatDialog in the application, and then restrict it only to those that have an id of modal-component, in other words, we are selecting only the logout modal we are working with. Angular Material components can be tricky to style so there’s a clear trade-off between their usability and the needs of each project.', 'With the CSS out of the way, there’s just one last thing to change, which is the app-modal‘s TypeScript. Here we need to do three things:', 'Whichever button the user clicks, for the sake of this demo, they will be returned to the “home page” of the application. In other words, whichever button the user clicks, the modal will close and show the big “Logout” button once more.', 'So, what’s the difference between the “Logout” button (the one inside the modal), and the “Go back” button? The first displays an alert box before closing the modal to let the user know they have logged out. The second button simply closes the modal.', 'Now let’s step back from the demo for a minute. Once the user clicks the “Logout” button and the application calls the actionFunction() function, that’s where your logic to execute the desired action comes in. In the case of a real logout, that’s where you’d have the code for wrapping up the user’s session. The other function, the function that cancels the operation the user initiated, simply closes the dialog and lets them return to the normal use of the application.', 'And with this we also have reached the end of the explanation. If you’ve followed along with the code, you now have a working modal dialog component which was dead simple to implement. Of course, in your real application you’ll be including services to interact with the server, and a modal can be applied wherever you need the user to confirm their action before actually executing it, such as when deleting an item.', 'If you have the project running, open your browser at localhost:4200 to see its finalized state. If it is not running, type ng serve --open in the command line and it will open a new tab in your browser automatically.', 'To end this article, I leave here a link to the complete code in a GitHub repository.', 'All constructive feedback is welcome as this is the longest technical article I’ve written and there’s probably plenty of ways in which I can improve. Have a great day :)']

Any positive event sent me to cloud nine, and any negative event took me down into the abyss.', 'It’s been years since I first came across Stoicism. Still, I find myself continually going back for guidance, especially when self-improvement, personal development, practical psychology, and other Cute Life Hacks can’t save me. Stoicism provides direction for dealing with the difficulties of life: losing a loved one, breaking up with a partner, or the smaller adversities like receiving bad news after a job interview.', 'Even though Stoicism is labeled as a philosophy, we can think of it as a tool: a tool for handling pain. Life is full of suffering, and this “philosophy” helps with coping.', 'Stoicism is ill-defined because of its complexity. No one-liner can capture its entire essence, but I’ll try anyway:', 'Stoicism is a philosophy of personal ethics whose goal is to deal with the misfortunes of life.', 'Stoicism is old. Zeno founded the philosophy in the early 3rd century BC. People didn’t experience the same difficulties with adjusting to the exciting digital world we do today, but they did have their own sets of problems. And life concerned them enough that they sought help from philosophy.', 'But many philosophies are fickle, intangible, and difficult to apply. Stoicism brought a new perspective to philosophy: one that exists to solve real solutions with real problems. Stoicism was concerned with what was real. It didn’t tell you to accept that everything is okay, or that things will get better, or that you’re going to heaven. It said that things could get worse: no lies and no false hope.', 'With immense practicality, Stoicism spread from the emperor to peasants. The philosophy didn’t bully you for experiencing difficulties. Instead, practitioners were encouraged to accept reality, do everything they can to change it, and give up control for the parts they can’t change.', 'My favourite definition of a Stoic comes from urban dictionary: a contemporary, comedic, and satirical perspective on a serious philosophy.', 'Stoic', 'Someone who does not give a shit about the stupid things in this world that most people care so much about. Stoics do have emotions, but only for the things in this world that really matter. They are the most real people alive.', 'Group of kids are sitting on a porch. Stoic walks by.', 'Kid — “Hey man, yur a fuckin faggot an you suck cock!”', 'Stoic — “Good for you.”', 'Keeps going.', 'Although Zeno was the official founder of Stoicism, later Stoics didn’t consider him wise enough to regard him as a Stoic. These following figures are men who I and many others believe had the most significant impact on the philosophy. They come from remarkably different backgrounds and have shaped Stoicism in their image.', 'Known as the kind, generous, and forgiving emperor, Marcus Aurelius ruled the Roman Empire from 161–180 AD. He spent most of his reign on the edges of his empire. Plagued by war and the loss of his men, he sought Stoicism to maintain his sanity.', 'Every day, he wrote to himself about empathy, discipline, and humility. Unbeknownst to him, these lessons would become one of the defining structures of Stoicism.', 'His journal, Meditations, is now one of the staples in the self-improvement community.', 'Seneca, the tutor and advisor to Nero (who, sadly, later executed him), was a celebrated rhetorician, satirist, author, and playwright. Some call him the ancient entrepreneur: a self-made wealthy man of his time.', 'In Letters from a Stoic, Seneca delivers Stoic lessons to help his friend manage his life. The book is a goldmine of life lessons and displays his mastery over human emotions.', 'Seneca has many other books, but if you’re only going to read one, I recommend these letters.', 'Unlike our other fathers, Epictetus wasn’t born into power, as he was born a slave. He grew to endure torture and created a framework to combat it, and thus became one of the most famous Stoics, tutoring our great emperor Marcus Aurelius himself.', 'Epictetus’s student Arrian published his teachings as Discourses and Enchiridion.', 'I introduced the Stoic fathers before I presented the philosophy. That’s because when I think about Stoicism, the first thing that comes to my head aren’t the ideas, they’re the people.', 'In times when I need to get my ego in check, I’ll often ask:', 'What would Marcus Aurelius do?', 'Life is not a blessing and positivity is not the key to a good life. Don’t ‘cheer up’ or ‘be happy’. Life is suffering, and you need to accept that. The Stoics taught these radical ideas, capturing the essence of human suffering and displaying them by voicing their beliefs:', 'Eradicate hope. Yes, things can get better, but they can also get worse. Hope creates expectations of improvement: expectations that will knock you down when you don’t meet them. Instead of telling people their lives could get better, Stoics told people their life could get worse.', 'Modern Stoics would say that you could get divorced, your children could die, and you might go to prison. You have to accept the possibility of these misfortunes. If they happen, you’ll get through it.', 'Negative emotions are the byproduct of mistaken judgments: an incorrect mental model of reality. To reduce these emotions, live in accordance with reality and accept everything that happens. Rationality and morality determine a good mental state.', 'People commonly mistake Stoicism to advise the removal of emotions. This is false, as the philosophy actually means to: take emotions out of the driver’s seat and place them in the passenger seat.', 'Our hedonistic modern lives can’t handle this one. Food is strictly for survival. Sex is only for reproduction. These are lessons that appear insane to apply. These days, we eat food and have sex mostly for fun: something Stoics advised against.', 'The Stoics believed material goods end up possessing you because you worry about maintaining them.', '“Almost nothing material is needed for a happy life, for he who has understood existence.”', '— Marcus Aurelius', 'We might not be able to apply this belief to sex and fun, but we can try with our possessions. Material goods are unnatural, so we should be careful with them, as they can end up owning us. So, understand that you can lose your material goods any time, and break free from their ownership of you.', '“Can you no longer see a road to freedom? It’s right in front of you. You need only turn over your wrists.”', '— Seneca', 'Even more radical is the Stoic belief that suicidal is okay: if you don’t want to live, you don’t have to. After all, life is difficult.', 'When Nero asked Seneca to commit suicide, he didn’t hesitate. On his deathbed, all he could think about was how to calm his wife and children from crying. He said:', '“What need is there to weep over parts of life? The whole of it calls for tears.”', 'I’m not telling you to commit suicide, or that the Stoic beliefs are the only rules for life. I’m simply explaining that these were their beliefs.', '“You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think.”', '— Marcus Aurelius', 'There have been a few times in my life where I thought I was going to die. As I accepted my false death, all I could think about were the things I could’ve done differently.', 'Memento mori: remember you must die. Stoics use this reminder not to promote a fear of death, but to accept it. Remember that one day your life will end, so appreciate what you have now. If you live as if you have infinite time, you can always wait for things to get better. Knowing you will die forces you to take action now.', 'I have a skull tattoo on my chest; others have “memento mori” tattoos. These are permanent options for people who have been deeply touched by Stoicism. Less permanent options include memento mori coins and gratitude journals to write about death with an appreciation of what you have now.', 'Tell yourself that you could get hit by a bus tomorrow. Then, ask yourself what you would do differently. Understanding your life could end soon will change how you think about the world.', 'Stoics aren’t the only practitioners of this technique. We also have the lovely Steve Jobs, who, in his famous Stanford graduation speech, said:', '“If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I’m about to do today?”', '— Steve Jobs', '“Misfortune weighs most heavily on those who expect nothing but good fortune.”', '— Seneca', 'Negative visualization is the act of imagining the loss of something important. The technique reduces the emotional impact of loss when it happens: you’ll have already emotionally dealt with the loss. The thought experiment is effective because, despite serious efforts to prevent losses, it still happens.', 'Most of us live in hedonic adaption: we chase our desires only to adapt to a new state of living where we have more desires. There’s no time to appreciate what we have now.', 'Negative visualization achieves the opposite of desire: the anti-desire. It reverses the hedonic adaption process. Instead of desiring things we don’t have, we desire what we already have, and we also accept that we can lose them.', 'In one of Seneca’s letters to his friend Lucilius:', '“Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with coarse and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: “Is this the condition that I feared?” It is precisely in times of immunity from care that the soul should toughen itself beforehand for occasions of greater stress, and it is while Fortune is kind that it should fortify itself against her violence. In days of peace the soldier performs maneuvers, throws up earthworks with no enemy in sight, and wearies himself by gratuitous toil, in order that he may be equal to unavoidable toil. If you would not have a man flinch when the crisis comes, train him before it comes.', '…', 'Let the pallet be a real one, and the coarse cloak; let the bread be hard and grimy. Endure all this for three or four days at a time, sometimes for more, so that it may be a test of yourself instead of a mere hobby. Then, I assure you, my dear Lucilius, you will leap for joy when filled with a pennyworth of food, and you will understand that a man’s peace of mind does not depend upon Fortune; for, even when angry she grants enough for our needs.”', '— Seneca', 'It appears extreme that he recommends to dress poorly and eat stale food. But it’s nothing so terrible. Seneca doesn’t ask us to put ourselves in physical danger.', 'Epictetus was even more unorthodox. He suggested that whenever you kiss a child, remember that she has been given to us “for the present, not inseparably nor for ever”. Then, we should reflect on the possibility that the child will die. It’s a morbid practice of negative visualization, but it works. Accepting the mortality of children creates a furthered appreciation for them.', 'Visualize your wife has left you. Visualize your car has crashed into a pole. Visualize living on the streets. Visualize losing what you’re afraid to lose.', 'After visualizing, Seneca says to ask yourself: “Is this the condition that I feared?”.', 'If visualizing isn’t enough to conquer the fear, live as if the thing of importance is already lost.', 'One of my Stoic friends, in an example to teach Stoicism, slept in a garden instead of a bed on a road trip. Nothing bad happened. He learned how to appreciate his bed more.', 'Examples of what to practice this on:', '“External things are not the problem. It’s your assessment of them. Which you can erase right now.”', '— Marcus Aurelius', 'Epictetus’s Dichotomy of Control states that some things are within our control; others aren’t. The internal is within our control; the external isn’t.', 'Our most important choice in life is to decide whether to concern ourselves with the internal or external. Perhaps you don’t agree with Epictetus, and this isn’t the Most Important Choice, but hopefully, you still believe it’s damn important.', 'Most choose the external and believe their environment possesses what’s good or bad. The Stoics challenged this. They believed all benefits and harm come from one’s thoughts and emotions. We have to give up certain things from our environment to gain calm, freedom, and tranquillity.', 'Desiring is wanting something we don’t have, which means we’ll be unhappy. To manage this, change your desires (internal), and not the world around you (external). Create a primary desire: to prevent frustration from having desires you can’t fulfil.', 'It’s easy for us to get caught up in the admiration of others on social media. The Stoics would advise us to not only understand that such lavish lifestyles are unrealistic, but that we should focus on managing our internal world instead.', 'We’re faced with people who have more than us every day. One example is at work: there are people with higher-paying positions, higher-impact positons, and even higher-relaxation positions.', 'It’s difficult to not feel some level of envy. Remind yourself that you can kill your desire. Ask yourself:', 'Would I still desire anything when I get what I want right now?', 'The answer is always yes. Desires never end.', 'Ask yourself:', 'If the answer is yes, then ask: “Do I want to do anything about it?”', 'If something isn’t within your control, or you don’t want to change anything, accept reality and move on.', '“Some things are within our power, while others are not. Within our power are opinion, motivation, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever is of our own doing; not within our power are our body, our property, reputation, office, and, in a word, whatever is not of our own doing.”', '— Epictetus', '“What ailment of yours have you cured today? What failing have you resisted? Where can you show improvement?”', '— Seneca', 'The Stoic fathers all had a journaling a habit. For them, the journal wasn’t just a place to recount what happened, but also a place to understand themselves. The journal was a place to reflect on experiences to improve: a place where they can be true to themselves with no criticism from the world outside. In a place of pure honesty, they could practice philosophy with earnest intentions.', 'Epictetus taught his students that journaling about philosophy was a way to exercise the mind. Marcus Aurelius’s journal was published as Meditations. Seneca reflected on daily events in his journal every evening after his wife went to sleep.', 'Seneca’s teacher Sexitus taught him to interrogate his mind with:', '“What ailment of yours have you cured today? What failing have you resisted? Where can you show improvement?”', 'Transforming these into contemporary language:', 'When Seneca was too aggressive in reprimanding a peer, he didn’t declare them as weak-willed. Instead, he advised himself that if he were to give constructive criticism, not only should he consider whether the criticism is valid, but also whether the person can handle it.', 'In my own reflections, the two questions I ask myself are:', 'These two questions help me practice gratitude and self-improvement. Copy mine, add your own questions, do whatever you want.', 'Tim Ferriss, a modern practitioner of Stoic philosophy, created his own product called The Five Minute Journal (non-affiliate link). If you don’t care about autonomy over your pages, start here.', 'I prefer a blank page so I can create my own structure, but you may prefer a pre-defined structure. Ferriss’s template is filled in with:', 'Morning:', 'Night:', '“It is a great consolation that it is together with the universe we are swept along.”', '— Seneca', 'Take a step back from your life and observe the universe as a whole. We’re a coincidental production of stardust: there is something out there but bigger than us.', 'The Stoics advised that we take a step back from our lives and look at the universe as a whole. They wanted us to imagine that we’re a lucky figment of something bigger than us and that everything that happens to us is bound to happen.', 'We don’t understand why what happens to us happens. So, accept that everything that happens to us is our fate. It’s somewhat deterministic, but there’s a practical mindset to follow. When life doesn’t meet our expectations, we get the feeling that the world is against us. The Stoics say: accept fate as you go through life.', 'Imagine we’re actors in a play. The playwright determines our fate, and our destinies are already written in the script.', 'We can’t choose our roles, actions, or the environment. We don’t know what’s going to happen next. We don’t know whether things will get better. We don’t know if the next is going to be the universe taking knocking us down again.', 'Accept, accept, accept. In times of misfortune, accept reality. Instead of desire, accept reality. For everything in life, accept reality.', 'Marcus Aurelius says that rejecting reality is rebelling against nature. We should love the fates bestowed upon us and take responsibility for our actions after things happen.', '“Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be one.”', '— Marcus Aurelius', 'Insights don’t matter without action. Start living your philosophy. The Stoics created virtues to guide them. When decision-making, they looked at their virtues and questioned whether they followed their principles.', 'The four Stoic virtues:', 'Wisdom is knowing what to choose: the power to differentiate between good and evil. It’s understanding when to display care and when to be indifferent.', 'Ultimate wisdom (the knowledge of all things) is impossible, but self-improvement is always possible, and you can always be wiser.', 'To practice wisdom is to be on a journey of continual growth: keep learning so you can learn how to make better decisions.', 'The courageous man makes the decision he believes is right. He chooses to exercise his will rather than succumb to fear. He still experiences fear, but he chooses to overcome it.', 'Stoic courage is the will to stare at fear and make the right decisions. It’s the heart to take risks to act morally. It’s the decision to insist on the truth when everyone else accepts the default.', 'To practice courage, ask yourself the following when making a decision:', 'Is this a courageous decision?', 'Have the willpower to say no. Understand when to restrain yourself, and when enough is enough. A modern cliché is: everything in moderation. The road to excess provides immediate satisfaction followed by long-term discontent.', 'Exercise self-control every day. Have the discipline to moderate yourself, so you can be happy.', 'To practice temperance, ask yourself:', 'Justice is the quality of moral rightness. It glues together society, as, without morals, we would live like savages. We would attack each other without care.

How do you make the lives of others better? If there are too few answers, find some.', 'We have a lot to learn from the Stoics. You can apply many of their techniques to live a healthy emotional life. Their practicality and well-grounded attitude have served me well.', 'But, take all philosophies with a grain of salt.

The announcement came after Wynn was forced to endure hordes of dissenters all focusing on trivial aspects of her YouTube content and social media presence, and to the disappointment of many — myself included — the purported empathy of leftist Twitter did not bear itself out as it was the main culprit in denying Wynn and many of her supporters a peaceful presence, thinking that coercively submitting to their every whim is somehow indicative of good praxis.', 'How we got from ContraPoints being the undisputed champion of minorities online to now becoming a notoriously-hated figure by the fringe crevices of political left Twitter isn’t all that immediately obvious — though, it follows a similar pattern seen from much more popular creators wherein being more present in the limelight exposes them to much more criticism, to the point where considering that much of it at once becomes a hindrance to the creative process.', 'Natalie ‘ContraPoints’ Wynn was slowly starting to dip her toes into being principally disagreed with as soon as she started to gain mainstream recognition, with a Verge article by Katherine Cross describing her as the “Oscar Wilde of YouTube” fighting the fierce winds of far-right extremism with “decadence and seduction”. The article — while generally flattering of Wynn’s methods in adopting feminine aesthetics to counter the patronizing harshness of the far-right — was but a mere convenient framing device for media, who’s always looking for a compelling story, in which the heroes and villains are clearly defined. ContraPoints served as a good candidate for the former, especially seeing as how trans representation in online media was confined to the narrow realms of being its own punchline up until that point. There was a noticeable shortage of trans presence, especially on platforms like YouTube, where the topic wasn’t strictly that of the trans experience or intrinsically tied to Beauty YouTube in some way. Wynn changed that by making intersectional analysis of the downtrodden’s woes a focus of her channel, regardless of how much they stray away from the cisgender binary.', 'It wouldn’t take long for Wynn to get exposed to much-loathsome backlash after the increased exposure she got from fans and dissenters alike. While fans remained largely-appreciative of ContraPoints’ content, dissenters were starting to harbor a distinct hatred for all that relates to BreadTube — the term denoting the progressive cohort of political YouTubers online — precisely because her face was starting to become analogous with the YouTube subculture for many. It was perceived by the ardent left as an affront to their righteous claim for a YouTuber who’d be willing to overstep the boundaries of identity politics well into the extreme — Natalie Wynn, who repeatedly kept having to deny any claim to messiahship, was ordained that responsibility anyway. That made her an easy target for harassment groups to rally against, and it made criticisms of her content much harder to distill as they kept being reiterated well-through unduly exhaustion.', 'The first culprit for ContraPoints’ — perhaps intentional — continued misunderstanding is a qualm with how she addressed non-binary issues in the past, precisely in the context of trans and non-binary inclusive spaces where she has to announce her pronouns and reassert her gender expression with little regard to what such a necessity entails. It didn’t help that a great chunk of it was more about monolithizing the non-binary experience, rather than figuring out the shades of grey lying in-between. That started a snowball effect wherein criticism of Wynn’s ideas was getting inextricably tied to her as a person, and subsequently caused her to deactivate her Twitter account in early September to cope with the unconscionable volume of discontent. To remedy the situation, Wynn hired a social media manager to foot the responsibility of her Twitter presence, which she then reassumed with their help in early October, hoping that the backlash would die down to such a point that she’ll be able to productively use the platform again.', 'Little did Wynn know that would only expose her to further ire, as a several-second cameo by controversial trans activist Buck Angel would yield her one of the darkest moments in her online presence, wherein she’s declared a transmedicalist — a term describing those who root trans identity in medical procedure — just by virtue of collaborating with Angel. If you’d seen the fires burning in the village from afar, you’d think her actions were akin to that of a regular day for serial trans offender Mitch McConnell, but now, this was against who many consider their primary gateway into progressive politics.', 'This backlash in particular donned many Gamergate-like qualities. Gamergate, self-adorning the duty of enforcing “ethics in game journalism”, motivated by the thorny trappings of group identity, turned out to be but a thinly-veiled racist and misogynistic hate campaign against those most-vulnerable in the gaming industry. Similarly, ContraPoints’ dissenters took her few questionable statements and extrapolated them into an overarching thesis where BreadTube is performing a platform-wide grift to scam leftists out of their money and attention. The problem is, it doesn’t factor much of the systemic disadvantage BreadTube already has against the right, who’ve had much longer and tacit support from the hate-coddling algorithms of YouTube to further their own brands in service of nefarious hateful ideology. BreadTube is already playing at a disadvantage, and seeing how it’s being beaten down by whom it’s supposed to cater to is a little disheartening.', 'Embattled with the swing of blades from every which way, ContraPoints’ reputation is likely to survive the ongoing assault despite how big it’s made out to be. The main question now is how will it affect the tone of her content — will she double-down on making a mockery of her critics, or will she try to use their furor in rallying support behind her and her colleagues? To me at least, the latter seems like a much more direct and effective approach. The time for jests is just about done, and as opinion-change-prone as her dissenters may appear, it looks as though nothing will dissuade them from thinking Wynn’s main preoccupation is personal gain, despite ample proof to the contrary.']

It happens to many of us. It’s the manifestation of that common phrase “you’re your own worst enemy”.', 'Self-sabotage is when part of your personality acts in conflict with another part of your personality — those times when you perform an action that intentionally impedes your progress.', 'People seldom mean to sabotage themselves. It’s not generally a conscious decision to stand in our own way.', 'So why do we get in our own way? Studies have correlated self-sabotaging behaviour with self-preservation.', 'Self-sabotage has a lot to do with human behaviour. Judy Ho, Ph.D., ABPP, a board-certified clinical and forensic neuropsychologist and Associate Professor of Psychology at Pepperdine University, argues that the propensity to commit self-sabotage is built into our neurobiology and woven into the very fabric of what makes us human.', 'She explains, “The source of self-sabotage is part of a common ancestral and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed us to persevere as a species in the first place. To understand how self-sabotage is tied to our human existence, we need to take a look at the two simple principles that drive our survival: attaining rewards and avoiding threats.”', 'The human brain is wired to cling to the familiar and to overestimate risk. We are drawn to go with the familiar, comfortable and the simple or easy path — even when a different option offers a clear advantage.', 'This tendency, known as the familiarity heuristic, leads us to overvalue the things we know and undervalue things that are unfamiliar.', 'Gay Hendricks PhD, the author of “The Big Leap: Conquer Your Hidden Fear and Take Life to the Next Level, explains, “Each of us has an inner thermostat setting that determines how much love, success, and creativity we allow ourselves to enjoy. When we exceed our inner thermostat setting, we will often do something to sabotage ourselves, causing us to drop back into the old, familiar zone where we feel secure.”', 'We engage in behaviours that seem to help us in the short term, only to discover they get in the way of the lives we really want to live.', 'In the grand scheme of things, you want the very best results for yourself today, tomorrow, next month and next year, but you stand in your own way.', 'Craig D. Lounsbrough, a Licensed Professional Counselor, once said, “The only reason I can’t jump in and engage life is that I’ve told myself I can’t. Yet I can’t help wondering what would happen if I told myself I could?”', 'Another little concept called cognitive dissonance is the reason you keep shooting yourself in the foot. Basically, the human brain likes to be consistent. Usually, our actions line up with our beliefs and values.', 'But when they don’t, we get uncomfortable and try to line them up again. This produces a feeling of mental discomfort leading to an alteration in one of the attitudes, beliefs or behaviours to reduce the discomfort and restore balance.', 'To overcome this inconsistency, we must do battle with our future self — the one who, in the present moment, will choose to self-sabotage.', 'When it comes to self-sabotage, the best thing you can do is understand where those feelings are coming from — and fight back against the tendency to spend a lot of time in your head, making a case against change.', 'Learn to tune out those excuses and keep on moving right through them no matter how much your present self-fights against your future self.', 'Find something so important that it is worth enraging your prehistoric fears. And start taking action now notwithstanding what your lizard brain tells you.', 'To overcome your fear of taking a step outside your comfort bubble, embrace new ideas, habits, experiences and activities into the largest possible amount of sub-steps you can imagine, and start making progress from there.', 'Write all the steps down if that helps. Prioritise them. Go back to the first item on your list and find the smallest possible action you can take to advance your goals. Aim for baby steps. Focus on small wins. The idea is to take even the smallest action towards the bigger goal.', 'Actions your brain won’t see as threats to your survival. If it’s too big a step, your resistance brain will cause you to overestimate the step as a threat — putting you on a path to self-sabotage.', 'Example, if you want to write a book, start with 200 words a day. Don’t judge your work. Just write. Ernest Hemingway once said, “Write drunk; edit sober”.', 'If you want to exercise, start with a five-minute routine, and build up from there, instead of half an hour or one hour (something you probably won’t be able to sustain).', 'If you fear closeness, intimacy or rejection in a relationship, you can overcome that by taking the gradual approach — something you can handle. Taking small steps towards more closeness can help you think more clearly and make better choices.', 'Use the same mindset or approach for anything you want to start. Choosing actions, however small, with full awareness will encourage good habits and momentum.', 'Commit to a process your brain can handle otherwise you will make excuses and sabotage the goal. Even if it’s 10 minutes a day. Any time you stumble, just get back up and take another run at it. That’s how progress happens.', 'You can also use the 2-minute rule to overcome procrastination. According to Productivity guru, James Clear, if a task takes less than two minutes to accomplish, you should do it immediately. He says you can apply the two minutes rule to start something new — that way, you won’t put off starting. Often, he says, you will keep going further than your allotted 2 minutes.', 'A work in progress no matter how small pushes you to continue working on your goals. People who are ultimately successful in initiating and maintaining major behavioural change usually do it through gradual, step-by-step changes. It’s one of the best ways to stop the patterns of behaviour that hold you back from living your best life.']

These are tragic motivations for something so intimate.', 'You must understand that your body is yours and you determine your values and the situations in which you might share that experience, and with whom. Not cave to external pressures.', 'This is your inalienable right, and if you don’t feel comfortable about something then you absolutely must not give in because you are acting as if your feelings don’t matter. You might think you won’t remember these occasions, but they linger.', 'If you’re not advocating for yourself, who will?', 'Many people who pursue new-age spirituality for purpose seem to end up selling one of its ideologies, products, or become more confused. The enlightenment of this philosophy is often “nothingness”, “being” and the “non-self”. This can be an impediment to self-actualisation.', 'Self-actualisation is you as something defined, engaging in your talents and developing potentials. New age spirituality however, portrays you as something indefinable.', 'This can result in eroding your ambition and capacity to work on your skills to unfold your potential. It can take away motivation by taking away a sense of a value hierarchy that allows you to pursue some things over others. It replaces vision of the future with the eternal present. Many people are stuck in liminality and indecision because of this.', 'The ego is the devil in this brand of spirituality, which is really the individual identity/personality as opposed to a collective identity. A kind of tribalism that elevates animal over man, nature over civilisation, imagination over the concrete... you’ll see that the advocates for this philosophy will dress in a tribal style that reflects this.', 'Unless it allows you to understand your own or another’s position with more resolution — it’s a waste of time. Almost always others won’t change their mind, so pick your battles.', 'Let’s be honest, it doesn’t matter how many ‘libtards’ or ‘nazis’ you destroyed, you were probably baited, trolled, or unironically responding to a satire article anyway.', 'Rants are emotional. The purpose isn’t necessarily to share carefully analysed information, but to purge. What sounds reasonable and effective when you are emotional is definitely unreliable in translating to those who are casually perusing social media. You probably look like an uninformed idiot that can’t control themselves.', 'Good rants are usually bottled up contemplations of professionals that have analysed a situation for a period of time, which provides fertile grounds for cultivating eloquence and insight instead of tumbling out like hot diarrhea.', 'This is a surprisingly hard conclusion for people to come to. It’s like every time there’s a bad experience, poor decision, or bad hangover, any potential lesson learned suddenly vanishes from memory — but once you see this in plain terms it kinda makes sense, right?', 'Alcohol can help foster a good time but quite often ruins one. It seems to make people a little more open but also a little more like animals; invoking the usually suppressed primal drives of lust and aggression to combat the wounding but necessary moderation of daily civility.', 'In my experience, they will not be receptive.', 'If someone has an insecurity that has allowed for an addiction, which in turn has created an alternate reality in the mind of the addict that rationalises away any consequence of their addiction, they are in deep shit.', 'You telling them they have to stop something they won’t acknowledge because it means dealing with the very things they are willing to destroy their lives over to avoid is probably not going to go well.', 'These people must come to conclusions themselves and won’t ask for help until their illusion breaks down after some heavy persuasion by life.', 'Do you really want to get involved?', 'You could become the scapegoat for their conflict. It takes a hell of a lot for people to break up sometimes, to the point of being delusional.', 'For example, some people will absolutely refuse to believe a partner has cheated even if they are told by multiple friends or even by the person who has slept with them themselves.

The only true justice is when a person understands their mistake, regrets it in proportion to the error, makes an appropriate amount of effort or sacrifice to remedy the mistake, and their new values render them incapable of the error.', 'This justice unfortunately is condemned to only come from their personal realisation, but some sense of justice comes from the fact that if they don’t realise it, they have not grown.

You give the perpetrator reason for rationalising away their own guilt by giving them evidence that you are just as bad as they are.', 'People neglect their potential by putting off cultivating skills in areas they are passionate about or might have an inkling that they are, creating a tension that is complicated, painful, and ill-defined.', 'It’s a tragedy when people neglect these things because these are what will develop them into who they want to be and allow them to provide value in the ways they want to provide it, despite the fear and self-doubt involved in the process.', 'This will wear down your confidence and waste precious time. Your life will become a routine and that is all. Developing a means of mental, emotional and perhaps physical escape won’t be healthy.', 'We should always continue to develop and act on a vision that helps motivate us in life and express who we are.', 'You’ll just have a useless degree and a lot of debt. Sometimes it is better to be entrepreneurial and go your own way if you’re up for the work and risk. Most people report learning everything they know on the job. It depends on the career choice of course. People might become suspicious if you’re a basement chemist.', 'Also, beware of subjects in the humanities. The subjects are valuable but it’s not like many people out there are going to employ you as a philosopher.', 'It could sure help you gain a position through exuding a sense of sophistication or erudition, but if you go this route you’re likely going to have to have great entrepreneurial skills as well in order to make a living.', 'Sure, you can do some of this. Experiences in travel and work are good things. I’m no fun police, but if you don’t have a sense of pressure because you’re in your 20’s, you’ll start hitting the wall pretty hard at 27–30 when you realise you either haven’t achieved anything, you don’t know how to support the rest of your life and you’ve wasted those years not giving a thought to your future.', 'Beware of rash decisions as well, especially when it comes to relationships and sex. You can be stuck with someone much sooner than you had the chance to determine your values.', 'Do your best to make a plan as you experience more of life and as above, cultivate skills.']

Meditation is proven to better preserve our brains, improve our mind focus and happiness, reduce anxiety and pain, and improve cognitive function.', 'And Insight Timer somehow lets users do it for free.', '7. Strava | Free | San Francisco, CA | CEO: James Quarles', 'The first social fitness network, Strava is the number one app for runners and cyclists. It has an international user community of over 40 million and a team that spends each day searching for new ways to inspire athletes and make the sports they love even more fun.', 'Since moving to the west coast of the United States, I’ve canceled all of my gym memberships. I only had one so it’s not as dramatic as that sounded. I’ve always found natural movements to resemble play, and learning the longevity secrets of the Blue Zones confirmed this. Natural movement is proven to reduce symptoms of depression, elongate lives, and make you happier.', 'Now, my pacific days consist of runs, hikes, rides, and walks, all tracked and shared in Strava. I even tracked my solo bike ride across America this summer in Strava. But, not every movement needs to be competitive and that’s what I love about Strava. The social network aspect creates an environment to connect and share your daily’s with friends.', '8. Mailchimp | Free | Atlanta, GA | CEO: Ben Chestnut', 'Mailchimp is an all-in-one marketing platform, most commonly used for email marketing.', 'Email lists are measured by the value of each subscriber. That individual subscriber value is a constantly debated metric and often shared only when it’s of an impressive value. Subscriber worth aside, the important message here is to keep an email list.', 'What started as a paid model, in 2009 Mailchimp introduced a freemium plan for those with under 2,000 contacts. If this is the first time you’re hearing of Mailchimp then this is probably you.', 'If you’re an entrepreneur or creator of anything, Mailchimp is something to familiarize yourself with. Beyond templates and email marketing, Mailchimp also offers custom landing pages and automation capabilities (enter your info here and you’ll see what an automation is).', 'It’s pretty impressive that Mailchimp offers this for free, and it totally reason enough to cancel that $25 annual mail merge extension.', '9. Tap | Free | Santa Monica, CA | CEO: Samuel Ian Rosen', 'FindTap is a first of its kind drinking network for smarter cities and a cleaner planet. With their app, users find the closest place to refill a water bottle within seconds.', 'This may not be a subscription, but it is something to use monthly. No, daily.', 'Never underestimate the power of two things:', 'With the FindTap app, you’ll reduce your single-use plastic, live more hydrated, and most likely discover some cool new shops that double as refill stations.', 'And if you had your calculator app open you know that for $32.43 per month, or $389.16 annually, you can leverage each of these tools every day in 2020.', 'Yesterday alone, I spent more than $32.43 in an airport restaurant on an unfulfilling veggie burger and green tea, so calculating this out made me cringe. But once my facial expression settled, the truth remained: For a veggie burger and green tea each month, I can radically transform myself.', 'You can too. That’s a no brainer.', 'One thing you may have noticed is that this list does not include Netflix, Hulu, YouTube TV or any other streaming service. This was intentional. As entertaining as the content within these platforms is, the majority of shows and series do not support a growth mindset. If anything, they encourage unhealthy and stationary behaviors. This, coupled with price increases due to the dissolution of many streaming platforms, validated the exclusion. Consider replacing the hours spent horizontal delaying sleep fixated on streaming screens with podcasts, yoga, or Medium. Or, if you enjoy reading, open a local library card and access their digital downloads from anywhere. Another free service.', 'A 2020 challenge for any reader still with me is to delete Uber, Lyft, or any other ride-sharing apps. Not only do these services increase congestion and contribute to climate disruption, but they also interfere with opportunity. In the absence of these services, opt for walking, riding a bicycle, or public transit, and observe your surroundings, rather than rush from destination to destination. At first, this will be challenging, that’s why it is a bonus, but be open to it. You will learn how to organize your day better, improve your travel planning, and may just meet some incredible people along the way.', 'Richie.

He later described it in his autobiography as an old maxim.', 'In 1969, researchers would confirm his maxim. Today, we call it “The Ben Franklin Effect.”', 'I’d first heard of it during a sales training years ago, and would learn more about it from Franklin’s autobiography. In it, he writes a story about an adversary of his in the Pennsylvania legislature.', 'Franklin wished to befriend or at least neutralize this adversary, so Ben asked him for a favor — to borrow a rare book. The adversary sent it, and Franklin returned it a week later with a note expressing his gratitude. When they next spoke, it was with great civility, a departure from their previous encounters. In time, they became lifelong friends.', 'He summed it up this way.', 'He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another, than he whom you yourself have obliged — Ben Franklin', 'Okay, a bit too 18th century, so I’ll modernize his quote. In short, logic suggests that if you do someone a favor, they’ll reciprocate. Not so, according to the theory. You are more likely to receive a favor from someone if they have already done one for you.', 'Cognitive dissonance explains why it works.', 'Let’s suppose you perform a favor for someone to whom you feel indifferent towards, or maybe even dislike. You now experience dissonance, an inconsistency between your belief and your action, which you must resolve. I just went out of my way to do a favor for this jerk. Why?', 'Your mind reaches for harmony between the two, so you alter your beliefs to fit your action. Eh, he’s not all bad. Actually pretty cool at times. It’s far easier to convince yourself you like the other person than it is to reason away your action or pretend it never happened. And since we do favors for people we like, we’re more likely to grant additional ones.', 'The possibility of using this technique intoxicated me. I’ve always suffered from a lack of charisma and have struggled with meeting new people. I was eager to try out this strategy, not to manipulate others, but to improve my likability.', 'Sorry, but you can’t go around asking people to do you favors and expect them to oblige. You might even annoy a shit-ton of folks. But that doesn’t mean you can’t employ the essence of what Franklin observed centuries ago.', 'If you read over the snippet about Franklin’s original request, you might notice the second factor at play. It wasn’t just a favor that he asked; it was a special kind, one that probably evoked a feeling of pride in his adversary.', 'Franklin’s adversary took great pride in his rare book collection. By asking to borrow from it, Franklin validated his adversary’s passion. He implicitly stated, “You have excellent taste and judgment in books.”', 'That kind of validation generates warmth and appreciation. It’s hard to avoid liking someone who compliments you on your excellence, passion, or taste.', 'Like most techniques to improve your interpersonal relationships, you need to put in effort on the backend before you execute on the frontend.', 'Pay attention to the subtle clues people drop in their conversations. What skills do they pride themselves in? What passions do they pursue? Ask questions to learn more about their likes and interests. Pay attention to the things they speak of most. You’ll discover what’s important to them.', 'By acquiring this information, you can seek small favors in a way that validates their passions and abilities.', 'Ask for a favor that’s easy to deliver but meaningful for you to receive. Don’t put someone in an uncomfortable position. Never ask someone to do you a favor when you should be paying them for their work. That’s a surefire strategy to make you unlikable.', 'By acquiring the right knowledge in step one, you’ll attune yourself to opportunities as they arise. You only need to pay attention to the subtle cues.', 'Perhaps an acquaintance of yours touts their chops as a foodie. She boasts about her connections with local restaurants. Since you have a date night planned with your partner, an opportunity presents itself.', 'You need a restaurant. Call that foodie acquaintance of yours. Ask her for a favor.', '“I have a special dinner planned for Friday,” you say. “I need to pick the perfect place. Can you do me a favor and help me?”', 'If she prides herself in this sort of thing, she’ll appreciate that you recognize her expertise. And since the ask is simple, she’ll oblige. She may even offer to set up the reservation with her contact.', 'Always express gratitude once the favor completes. Start with a sincere thank you. Include a sentence about how it benefitted you or what it meant to you. Sandwich it with a closing, thank you.', '“Thank you for getting us into that restaurant. It was an unforgettable evening. My partner can’t stop talking about it. Thanks again. I appreciate your help.”', 'Avoid saying something like, I owe you one, or I’ll make it up to you. That makes it transactional. Friends do things for each other out of kindness; they don’t enter into transactions.', 'Ben Franklin made a lifelong friend when he asked an adversary to borrow a book. Simply asking people for favors won’t make you more likable. It might even make them resent you.', 'Instead, learn about people’s passions and interests. Ask for a targeted favor when the opportunity arises. And always remember to express gratitude in a way that demonstrates how much it meant to you.']

Having all the hours in the day won’t help you if you’re exhausted for most of it.', 'Your habits define your energy levels. If you have good habits, you’ll feel energized and be more resilient to burn out, both physically and mentally. If your habits are misaligned, you can get into a cycle where you feel worse and worse, until your it’s a struggle just to keep up.', 'Here are nine habits you can work on this year to increase your energy levels.', 'Sleep is the foundation of your energy. If you don’t get enough sleep, you’ll start to underperform.', 'While some people claim to work best on six or less hours of sleep, research says they’re kidding themselves. Seven to eight hours are pretty much mandatory if you’re going to stay cognitively sharp in the long-run.', 'For some people the sleep deprivation may have mentally plateaued, meaning they feel slightly tired all day, but they don’t think they’re getting any worse. An interesting experiment showed that sleep deprivation caused continuous declines in mental performance, even though subjects felt like they were holding steady.', 'Try this: Go to bed by 10pm every night, including weekends, for the next thirty days.', 'Exercise is a long-term investment in your energy levels. It’s easy to cut in the short-term, but over time you’ll reduce your overall fitness, making it harder to think straight and stay alert throughout the day.', 'If you struggle to find time for exercise, don’t make going to the gym your prerequisite. Make a habit of doing some pushups or burpees every day throughout the day. These will get your heart pumping and blood moving, and they don’t require setting aside two hours from your already busy schedule.', 'You can add gym or fitness classes on top of this foundational habit, but this basic investment in exercise will keep you sharp when you can’t make it to the gym.', 'Try this: Do at least 10 burpees every day from your home.', 'Napping may feel lazy, but there’s research showing it has a range of cognitive benefits. This is particularly true if you’re doing a lot of learning, since the short burst of sleep can help with memory.', 'I used to feel guilty taking naps, believing it was a sign of weakness. Now, I think it’s definitely a strength. A short nap can turn you back on for work in the afternoon, when you’d normally be exhausted. Even if you work in an office that doesn’t encourage napping, you can use a slice of your lunch break, to quickly rest.', 'The key is to learn how to take short naps. Many people take naps which are too long, pushing them into deeper phases of sleep which cause them to feel even groggier when they wake up (although the benefits to even these naps often occur after the initial grogginess wears off). The key is to wake up immediately with your alarm. If you start adding more time, a quick nap can become a long sleep.', 'Try this: Insert a 20 minute nap after you eat lunch to recuperate your energy for the afternoon.', 'Aim to get your most important work done in the first four hours of the workday, starting as soon as possible.', 'The benefits to your energy here are mostly psychological. My energy levels depend a lot on my mood. If I’ve gotten some important work done, my mood is usually good and I feel productive. If I’ve wasted time on emails, meetings, calls or failed to produce something valuable, I’m often frustrated and exhausted entering the second half of the day.', 'The other reason for this approach is that deep work isn’t always sustainable for the full workday. Better to concentrate it into a specific period than randomly insert it across chunks of time.', 'Try this: Make the first four hours of your morning a quiet, deep work zone.', 'Energy is often about momentum. Start working hard and you’ll overcome procrastination and keep going throughout the day. Start slow and you may end up struggling against your own impulses, wasting the energy on things that aren’t productive.', 'One way to avoid this is to set a very clear intention of how your day will go, particularly in the beginning, the night before. Visualizing this intention and writing it down into your schedule can make it happen more automatically when you wake up.', 'Try this: Before you go to bed, write down your plan for the next day and visualize it.', 'Many people simultaneously hold two contradictory beliefs: that other people (marketers) are really good at persuading them to do all sorts of things they wouldn’t do otherwise, but that they themselves have no ability to change their own motivation to do the things they have to do.', 'The truth is, you need to become the salesperson for your own goals. Not for other people, but for yourself.', 'Part of that starts with packaging — how you frame your goals and projects can have a huge effect on your motivation. Is this something you have to do? Or an exciting challenge?', 'Next it comes from refreshing and reminding yourself of your inspirations. Why did you get started down this path? What were you hoping to achieve. Good marketers know to focus the customer on visualizing what they want to drive sales. You can focus yourself on what you want to have the energy to get it done.', 'Try this: Set aside ten minutes every day to think about what today’s actions are helping you build towards.', 'You may not be able to choose your parents, colleagues or your boss. But you do have some control over the friends in your life.', 'You know that some friends you leave a conversation with them feeling excited and energized. Others you leave feeling even worse than you did beforehand.', 'You don’t need to exclude friends who are going through temporarily rough times, but you should consider who you spend your time with when there are people who consistently create one-sided emotional exchanges as the basis for your relationships. Everyone needs a shoulder to cry on sometimes, but some people will expect you to be their permanent shoulder.', 'Try this: Set a time limit on friends who leave you feeling drained.', 'One of the great benefits of reading books isn’t simply to give you ideas and information. Rather it’s to reinforce a mentality that often occurs at a subconcious level. The best books aren’t those that teach you facts, but those that subtly change your entire thinking patterns.', 'Audio books can be very useful for this, since you can listen to them and re-listen to them on the go every day. A good book for this is one that, when you listen to it, automatically adjusts your thinking onto the things you need to work hard on. Just like a good song can be the background for a particular emotion, a good book can be the background for a particular energy of thinking.', 'Try this: Always have an audio book that motivates you to work on your goals.', 'The last habit isn’t a one-time process, but an ongoing effort to bring the different elements of your life out of conflict and into alignment with one another.', 'A lot of energy is squandered because the different parts of our lives, both internal and external, are in conflict with each other. That could be the colleague at work who doesn’t want you to get promoted, the friends who make fun of your goals or even the internal fears and assumptions that keep you hesitating.', 'Spend some time untangling the different conflicts in your life to see how you could resolve them. Sometimes that can be done in the short-term, by making a change. Sometimes, it requires a long-term plan to escape the toxic environment, social circle or belief system that holds you back.', 'Try this: Sit down for an hour and brainstorm all the things which assist your goals and all the things which hold you back. How could you resolve those tensions?', 'What habits have you built to give you energy to work hard on the things that matter to you? Share your thoughts in the comments!']

My iPhone XR isn’t 414-by-896-pixels wide, it’s actually 828-by-1792-pixel, twice as much!', 'What happens is this:', 'The artboard is rendered at twice as much pixels, since the iPhone XR has a Retina display that has twice as much pixels per inch (ppi), than a regular screen.', 'In the case of the iPhone X, the artboard is rendered at 3 times as much, since it has a Super Retina display that has 3 times as much ppi.', 'Designing for the smallest size allows us to scale our assets into the different sizes the different devices require, while maintaining pixel-perfect rendering. And so, 1pt can be translated into 1, 4 or 9 pixels at the @1x, @2x and @3x sizes, respectively.', 'So if we have an icon at the size of 16px, when we’ll export that icon at @2x and @3x, the rendered images will be 32px and 48px respectively, and will suit Retina and Super Retina displays.', 'For Apple’s guidelines on the subject of image size and resolution.', 'Several reasons, the first being that it scales perfectly in all the different screen displays (including android’s @0.75 and @1.5).', 'The second reason, well, Apple and Google advise so, albeit without stating too many reasons why.', 'The third reason — it’s a good basic unit to work with. the numbers 4 and 8 are easily multiplied, they provide flexible and consistent, yet distinct enough, steps between them. They’re kind of fun when you get use to them 🤓.', 'When I establish a typographic system, I strive to keep my styles distinct enough yet consistent, so my design will have that inner logic that gives the design that Je ne sais quoi feeling.', 'While font sizes may vary and stray from the 8 multiplication, it’s important the line height will not. The Paragraph font size can be 15 pixels for example, but the line height should be a multiplication of 8, so 24px is an acceptable value.', 'In order to create a consistent typography system fast, I use one of my favorite tools: Grid Lover.', 'Tip: Any font you got installed on your machine, will be displayed by entering the font’s name exactly as you would in a CSS document; usually, simply the font’s name.', 'As mentioned above, icons designed on an 8pt based grid will scale perfectly:', 'If you intend on using icons in a different size, I would recommend designing your icon on 16×16 pixels grid, and another version on a 20×20 pixels grid. This way you’re covered for any size: 16, 20, 24 (16×1.5), 32, 40 and so forth.', 'Since I’ve been coding a part of the projects I work on, I’ve been using Bootstrap’s standard 12 grid with a minor modification. I’m a big believer in working with widespread tools — why? Well, there’s a reason they’re so widespread. They work and they’re efficient. Instead of reinventing the wheel, I prefer modifying the one I got. It’s cost efficient, fast and predictable.', 'Customizing the Bootstrap grid is natively supported and very easy to do; If you’re somewhat literate in CSS, here’s a guide for exactly that.', 'The standard Bootstrap grid is a 12 column layout, with a 15px margin on each side of the column; resulting in a 30px gutter between columns plus 15px to the left and right of the grid. These are the default settings, which I’ll configure to my liking, or ask the developer to configure.', 'The entirety of the grid is called Container. A container can be either fluid or responsive in size. A fluid container will always take the entirety of the width that is available.', 'For each screen range there is a container width that is optimized to that screen range. At first it’s recommended to use the default sizes, however it’s pretty cool to customize when you’re further down the 8pt rabbit hole.', 'When our Bootstrap-based-website is displayed on any device, The browser checks to see home much space is available for display, and sets the layout according to that space. If we have a 414px wide iPhone, we’re in the Extra small category, and out container will take up 100% of the width available. When will switch to a wider device, let’s say a tablet (768px wide), our device category will change to Medium, and the container’s width will be 720px.', 'If you’re like me, you’d like to customize those settings. We’ll start by whipping out our calculators \U0001f9ee.', 'When designing for desktop I’d like to have each column be 72px wide, and have a gutter of 24px or 32px. A gutter of 24px will result in 12px on each side of the container, and a gutter of 32px will result in a 16px on each side. I usually opt for the 24px gutter.', '(12 columns × 72) + (12* gutters × 24) = 1152px', '*Technically there are 11 gutters plus two halves on each side of the container.', 'Designing for mobile presents a few new challenges. First, not all mobile devices’ width dimension is divisible by 8. In this case, it’s important to rely on your own instincts as a designer, and find a middle ground. Second, 12 columns aren’t really practical when designing for narrow screens. I myself opt for a 6 column layout on mobile, although when I experimented with a 2 column layout, the end results weren’t any worst off.', 'This one is up to you to decide for yourself.', 'For a screen that’s 375pt wide, use these settings:', 'Preserving the gutter width is more important than preserving the column width, since the gutters act as the white space between elements — and that is what actually determines the rhythm; while the columns dictate the width of an element.', 'A 1152px container isn’t very different from Bootstrap’s default 1140px container and is still in the device (desktop), range. So I’m not worried of any discrepancies or problems.', 'Important: Layout’s width should be based on the content and user needs. If you see it just doesn’t work with the 8pt grid, no worries. We’re designers and we should be flexible when we need to.', 'You guessed it, our rows are going to be 8px tall. Some may go even further and have 4px rows — This allows for any line height which is a multiplication of 4, which is great. However, I found out that it takes more energy to maintain than it gives value in the output. So 8px is good enough for me.', 'When designing for mobile (web or apps), vertical rhythm is the name of the game, since there isn’t much horizontal rhythm to work with. So maintaining that vertical rhythm consistent and beautiful is doubly important.', 'A typographic system that is designed based on the 8pt grid, will sit wonderfully on an 8pt vertical grid.', 'You can define your spacing values as variables:', 'This way it’s easier to maintain consistency, it’s more logical and the developers are happy since they can safely assume spacing based on the relationship between the elements on the screen.', 'Stay tuned for the next article, where we’ll put the 8pt grid into an atomic design system.

They help you build a common understanding and remove much of the complexity and nuance that comes with written and verbal language.', 'I wanted to share 6 diagrams I find myself frequently using to when discussing Product Management ideas. These are a few drawings are well-received and convey the point well. The 6 diagrams are:', 'Please feel free to use them in any way you find beneficial to your role.', 'One of the most common mistakes I see Product Managers make is feeling the need to be a part of every discussion. I understand there is a positive intention behind it — you’re the PM and you need to be across everything in case you’re asked about it.', 'Unfortunately, this has many drawbacks. First, it’s not practical. You will rapidly become overwhelmed — negatively impacting not only the effectiveness of your team but also your own well-being. Trust me, I’ve done it. Second, you undermine the autonomy of your team.', 'Great Product Managers know when to be involved and when to step back. They know when to let conversations happen without them. The purpose of an autonomous team is to remove as many dependencies as possible.', 'In the example below, you can imagine a situation on the left where the Web Engineer asks about a tracking concept to be implemented, the PM then approaches the Product Analysts who said it should match the iOS implementation. The PM then approaches the iOS Engineer in order to collect the details and goes back to the Web Engineer to explain them. Not only does this add unnecessary work to the PM, but it also delays the resolution the Web Engineer is seeking.', 'In comparison, in the example on the right, the Web Engineer directly approaches the Analyst who explains the situations. They then align with the iOS Developer. Note how many fewer interactions (red arrows) need to happen.', 'If we extend this example and add another couple of topics (green and blue) which is probably more representative of the concurrent number of initiatives a team will have. The number of interactions rapidly increases and these are all dependent on the PM.', ""How to use this: If you’re constantly overwhelmed, reflect on how your team interacts with each other — do you need to be in every meeting? Does your team operate the same when you're on vacation or does everything stop? If it’s the latter, you need to make a conscious effort to facilitate interactions without you. (More extensive article on this topic coming soon!)"", 'This is one of my favourite diagrams for explaining the throughput of teams and size of initiatives being worked on. I often come across frustrations both from business partners and Product Teams about their time-to-market — they feel it’s too slow.', 'The problem is usually caused by only working on larger chunks of work (funnel on the left). As a result, a team can only work on one topic at a time. This approach may be acceptable if we’re certain something is the right thing to build, but this is very rarely the case. If something drops out the bottom of our pipeline and it doesn’t work, you spent more effort than required in order to get to that learning.', 'The reason the agile approach promotes smaller chunks of work is because value delivered quicker and with less risk. The funnel to the right gives us much more flexibility. Smaller pieces of work (blue dots) can move through the funnel at a rapid pace to be validated. If they’re successful, we can invest more effort (small pink circle). If it’s unsuccessful, we iterate again but with limited investment. Each validation allows us to continue to increase our investment. This results in many small projects, some medium projects and a few large projects — off-setting risk and improving ROI.', 'How to use this: Look back on what you’ve worked on over the last few months (not just what you shipped). Were all the topics large in scale and complexity or were there a mix of ongoing pieces of work? These may all be in the same theme or different. Assign a basic size to each piece of work (S, M, L) and reflect on what your funnel would look like.', 'There have been various examples of this around the internet, but I wanted to emphasis the point of effort. Many Product organisations are not explicit about the fact that the time of the team itself is an investment. If all Product Managers owned the Profit & Loss statements for their product, the wage line item would often be the largest expense. You should look for every opportunity to increase Profit (Return).', 'When teams ship after a large release, you hope to get an immediate hit of value. Even operating on the assumption that you release the perfect solution with no technical issues first time (spoiler alert: it’s unlikely). There has been a large investment made by your team (in terms of time) that has not returned anything (left diagram).', 'By releasing small and often, you’re shipping incremental pieces of work. This begins to pay off because you can realise value sooner and learn from mistakes faster. Value trends above effort almost consistently in the second graph and this is what teams should be striving for.', 'How to use this: I often use these diagrams as a way of explaining why “just adding one more thing” to the scope probably isn’t in our organisations best interest. It’s also extremely helpful to remind yourself and your team the commercial aspects of your roles.', 'There are two aspects to this chart. On the left, is the initiative pyramid itself. The width of the pyramid shows how many initiatives should be on-going at once. The wide base signifies many topics and the narrow point means few. In order to make this viable, the higher risk topics are at the top (few) with lower risk ones at the bottom (many).', 'On the right, is a gauge for leadership involvement. The wider the gauge, the more involvement should be expected or required. In this case, more leadership should be consulted.

I started out with an Apple Notes App on my laptop and work phone to keep track of meetings, training, action items, and learnings.', 'One day I logged into my computer and found all my notes had disappeared. My workplace had blocked the Apple Notes App because it used iCloud instead of the company’s own cloud (understandable).

Wear OS: Dawn of…	209	0	https://medium.com/@joshuabeckthewriter	https://medium.com/swlh/battle-royale-with-cheese-samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-vs-fossil-gen-5-126a3b45b4d8?source=collection_archive---------8-----------------------	32	1	['Battle Royale (with Cheese): Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 vs. Fossil Gen-5']	94	['Last week, I wrote about the choices Android users have for a smart watch; primarily, I broke it down between Fitbit, Samsung, and Wear OS (there are other options, but those three are the ones most readily available, and the ones I’ve worn on my wrist).', 'Today, however, I’d like to get a little more in-depth with two of the three options: Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Active 2 and Google’s Fossil Gen-5. Both are similarly priced (and went on similar discounts this Black Friday), and I’d say they are two of the best options for any Android user who wants a watch that does more than tell time.', 'Unfortunately, Android doesn’t have one smartwatch to rule them all like iOS does. Neither are the best option, however, and I want to get into where each watch excels, and where each falls short.', 'Keep in mind, I’ve paired both to my Google Pixel 3a, which I think is a pretty good phone to test both watches on. If you use a Samsung phone, the Watch Active 2 will have a bit of a leg up on Wear OS (I’ll get to that).', 'Let the battle commence.', 'Let’s get the little things out of the way, shall we? Both watches have the same size screen (44mm; the Galaxy Watch Active 2 is also offered in 40mm with a cheaper price and slightly smaller battery), and both are decently comfortable to wear on a daily basis.', 'The Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 is a very sleek watch (especially if you get one of the stainless steel models; mine is, sadly, aluminum, but still very nice), reminiscent of the Apple Watch (except, you know… round), whereas the Fossil Gen-5 looks like a more traditional watch (in fact, it looks very similar to this regular Fossil Watch). Both look good enough to wear on a daily basis and even when you are in formal wear. I’d say the Samsung Watch is better if you want your intelligent timepiece to stand out a bit, and the Fossil is best if you want it to blend in with other watches until you turn the screen on. That said, with everyone wearing Fitbits and Apple Watches these days, Fossil’s tried and true design might actually be the one that stands out.', 'The silicone watch bands that both came with irritated my skin, but that’s more of a personal problem, and something I solve quickly with a couple cheap watch bands from Amazon (ironically, both I got are copies of Apple’s popular Apple Watch bands; a Milanese loop and a sport loop). Neither watch comes with different size bands like Fitbits and Apple Watches, although Samsung’s original Galaxy Watch Active did. That was a bit of a shame, as the bands they came with were barely long enough for my wrists (before I got the 44 mm Watch Active 2, I tried the 40 mm, and that strap was too small; keep that in mind if you have a larger wrist).', 'As for the watch itself, the Samsung is somewhat lighter than the Fossil, but it also seems a little bulkier; they are actually about the same thickness as one another, but the Fossil’s tapered design gives the illusion that it’s a thinner device. Despite being lighter, however, it seemed like I felt the Samsung more on my wrist than the Fossil; that may be due to the larger sensor on the back of the Samsung, which seemed to leave a mark on my wrist after several hours, no matter what strap or band I was wearing or how loosely I wore it. It didn’t hurt; it was just noticeable.', 'The Fossil also has three physical buttons on one side that jut out a bit like a regular watch (the middle, of course, is a spinning crown). Depending on which wrist you wear it on, those knobs could cause some added annoyance, however, they are all relatively smooth. But they are definitely more of an irritant than the two flush buttons on the Samsung. A few times, I accidentally summoned Google Assistant or powered off the watch when I bent my wrist.', 'Winner: Tie; just depends on your personal preference, but I don’t think you can go wrong with either in the looks department. Neither are cheap-feeling or overly bulky.', 'That brings us to the ways you interact with the watches. Both, of course, are touchscreen, and the same size touchscreen, so navigating on either is relatively easy.', 'Where the watches begin to differ is the other ways you interact with the devices. On the Fossil, you can use the aforementioned buttons for quick navigation. The center crown quickly pulls up notifications and settings from the watch face, and scrolls through apps when you press the button in once. The other two buttons are programmable to open whichever apps you prefer to use quickly. I set it to Messages and Google Fit, although I’m not married to the latter (I just didn’t have a better option at the time). A double press of the top button also gets you to Google Pay, and I thought a double press of the bottom took your heart rate, but once I remapped the bottom button to trigger Google Play Music (no YouTube Music?!?), I realized there is no double press function for the bottom button; I was just triggering what the bottom button does once you are in the app. When using the music controls (the native music controls, not in the Spotify app), the top and bottom buttons function as back and forward track buttons, and the crown works for volume control. This is a useful function if you are wearing gloves or can’t look at the screen for some reason.', 'Oddly, though, the rotating crown doesn’t work in most of the apps you can download on the Fossil; the crown spins uselessly once you enter an app, and you are forced to use the touchscreen to navigate. It doesn’t even work on the Google Assistant screen, which lives to the left of the watch face. It’s not bad, it’s just weird, weird that so many apps don’t have the functionality built in to use the main control feature on the watch. It is even inconsistent within apps and settings; several times I’ve encountered areas where the crown scrolls through one screen, but once I make a selection it doesn’t work on the next screen. Because of this, I feel like I waste a a few seconds each time trying to use the crown to scroll before I remember I have to touch the screen.', 'Holding the crown in activates Google Assistant, and you can also access Google by swiping to the right on the screen (only from the watch face; otherwise this gesture is a back button). Swiping left on the watch face gives you app widgets. Up gets you to notifications, and down gets you to some quick settings.', 'On the Watch Active 2, you get two almost flush buttons on the side. The top button- which is elongated a bit- serves as a back button, and with a long press activates Samsung Pay. It also houses the watch’s electrocardiogram sensor, which Samsung has yet to activate. The bottom button pulls up your list of apps, and with a double press activates your shortcut (by default this is Bixby, but you can and should change it, if for nothing else than the fact that you can summon Bixby with your voice at any time).', 'There’s no rotating crown, but there’s a rotating touch bezel surrounding the screen. This was a feature sorely missing from the original Active, and one of the biggest selling points for the 6-month newer Active 2. Unlike on the Fossil, where the crown has very limited functionality, Watch Active 2’s operating system seems entirely built around this method of using the device. From the watch face, running your finger clockwise takes you through widgets for different apps (similar to Google’s, but much better; I’ll get to that). Counterclockwise takes you through notifications. Like on the Fossil, a down swipe gives you quick settings, although unlike the Fossil, you can pick and choose which settings to have on this screen. On the Samsung, you can also access the quick settings panel from any screen, whereas on WearOS, you have to be on the watch face to access it. Again, not bad, just weird; at least the watch face is just a click of the crown away from wherever you are at all times.', 'Where the big difference in the interface is, however, is in the apps. While you could argue that Google has a better app store than Samsung, I haven’t come across an app yet on the Watch Active 2 that didn’t utilize the touch bezel. Where the rotating crown works like a dead fish in the Spotify app, for example, the touch bezel scrolls through lists and tracks, skips songs while you are playing music, and controls the volume (if you use the Google Play Music app or the regular music controls while playback is coming from your phone, the crown does control volume, and the buttons skip tracks). It feels like a much better implementation of the available technology, and with Samsung’s better widget interface, it just feels like you get to the information you are looking for faster on the Samsung Watch Active 2.', 'That information also seems to make better use of the screen on the Samsung watch. For one thing, on the Samsung, each notification is given it’s own separate screen to the left of the watch face. On the Fossil, notifications are presented as a list of white text on a black background. You can tap to expand a notification and see your interaction options, but otherwise it is just a list. When a new message comes in on the Samsung, the screen is filled with the face of the person sending you the message while it loads, where the Fossil just shows- once more- white text against a black backdrop. Since both watches are OLED screens, that is probably a bit of a battery saver for the Fossil (and the Fossil definitely needs it, but I’ll get to that), but I find reading a message is much easier on the Samsung screen. Buttons, like the reply button for a message, are also bigger and more colorful on the Samsung, which just makes it easier to hit what you wanted.', 'Winner: Samsung. The touch bezel and how everything reacts to it stands a clear mile above Fossil’s half-baked rotating crown.', 'But the interface doesn’t matter as much compared to the usefulness of the watch. I mean, that’s why you bought a smart watch, is it not?', 'And, frankly, you won’t go wrong with either watch in this case; both will offer the standard features of health tracking, text messaging, phone calling, music controls, etc. and so forth. And whatever task you set upon to do with your watch, you will accomplish it just fine.', 'Both watches get stuff done quickly, too; that was a major pain point with the Fossil Sport I tried earlier this year, as I found Wear OS clunky and laggy, but Fossil has expanded the memory on this watch and I really only experienced lag when I first turned on the watch (or restarted it after the battery died). Overall, the Fossil Gen-5 has a much better Wear OS experience than previous models. Samsung’s benefit in this area is the same as Apple’s for the Apple Watch: the OS and hardware Samsung is using in their watch were specifically designed for each other.', 'But the experience does differ between the two, especially for the Samsung watch when you aren’t using a Samsung phone.', 'The primary example is with messaging. The Watch Active 2 (and any Samsung watch) is designed to work with Samsung’s own messaging app. And that’s a damn shame; I even tried to install Samsung’s app on my Google Pixel, and it just didn’t work. That means you won’t have the full messaging app on your watch, and you can’t go back and look at the whole conversation that you’ve had with the person. You can absolutely still use the watch for messaging, however; you will still get all your notifications from Google’s messaging app, which you can reply to, and you can send a new message to anyone by selecting them from your contacts list or by asking Bixby- yeah, Bixby- to do it. I tried downloading a third party messaging app that was supposed to work with the Samsung watch a little better (Pulse Messenger), but I could never get it to sign in on the watch, so I can’t say how well that would have worked once I got it to… you know… work.', 'On the Fossil watch, messaging works exactly like you’d expect it to. You can reply to notifications, tell Google to send a text, and view your entire conversation in the app. With Google’s Messages app installed on the watch, you can also view a picture that has been sent to you, whereas the Watch Active 2 will only tell you that you’ve received a picture.', 'How you send a text differs as well. Of course, on both watches you can dictate a message, and frankly, Google is a better listener. On the Fossil, you can also use a full- yet small- swipe keyboard to write out your message. Samsung offers a similar letter-drawing program like you will find on the Apple Watch, as well as a T9 keyboard for when you would rather type it out (but who wants to use a T9 keyboard?). Both input methods work well enough; drawing each letter takes longer, but the full keyboard is so small that it is too easy to hit the wrong letter. Google is smart enough to guess what you meant to type most of the time, but if you are spelling a name or something, it’s very, very easy to mess up. I did, however, find the swipe keyboard easy to use no matter which wrist I wore the watch on, whereas drawing letters was a real chore when I wore the watch on my dominant hand.', 'Either watch works fine when using them to reply quickly to a message, and replying with a quick message. And, frankly, that’s all you really need; if you are having a more in-depth conversation or writing longer responses, chances are you are going to do that on your phone anyway, right?', 'Winner: Tie. In most areas, I’ll give this to Samsung, however, if you are using anything other than a Samsung phone, the Fossil will give you a better messaging experience.', 'One of the best features of having a smart watch is having your digital assistant on your wrist. And that’s perhaps the biggest difference between these two watches.', 'Of course, the Fossil watch will have Google Assistant front and center. And it functions just as you would expect Google Assistant to do. At least, almost. I’ve found there are certain commands that I can ask my phone that the watch stumbles over. For instance, asking Google Assistant to pause the music I’m listening to on my phone- or to skip a track- comes back with “Nothing is playing right now” even though the watch shows me the track that is playing on my phone. Similarly, when I asked Assistant to read my messages, it just said “anything else?”', 'Samsung, unfortunately, pairs their watch with Bixby. But as lackluster as Bixby is, for the most part it does the job it is intended to do on the watch, though at times it is mighty slow to load. It performed the similar task of pausing or skipping my song without question, however, when I tried to repeat the event it tried to tell me to sign in to Spotify (I was playing music in Google Play Music) and then told me nothing was playing (I had to first go to the music player so that it synced up with my phone; once it did, telling it to pause the song worked instantly). But again, if you aren’t using a Samsung phone, it is incapable of reading your latest messages.', 'Reminders are another pain point regardless of which Assistant you use. With the Samsung, you can set reminders through Bixby, and Bixby reminds you promptly, but those reminders don’t carry over to your non-Samsung Android phone in the event you aren’t wearing the watch when the reminder goes off. Likewise, you can set reminders on your phone with Google Assistant, but I haven’t been able to get the Samsung watch to mirror those notifications (which is a real problem). On the Fossil watch, I can set a reminder with Google Assistant, but I’ve encountered a weird bug wherein the reminder fails to go off until I’ve unlocked my phone (passing the timestamp I gave it), and the watch doesn’t show the reminder at all. I looked this up after spending hours (yes, hours) looking at settings on the watch and the phone, and discovered that this has been a known issue in Wear OS for almost 2 years. That does not bode well, but I’ll get to that in a little bit.', 'And if you really need Google’s intelligence on your Samsung watch, there’s a hack for it. It’s relatively easy, and I’ve actually set it to replace the quick action for Bixby on my watch. It can’t do all the things that Assistant can do on your phone- it can’t even do all the things Bixby can do on the watch (it is given no access to the watch’s functions at all)- but it is a hell of a lot better than Bixby when it comes to getting information (Bixby couldn’t even tell me who Abraham Lincoln was).', 'Same as with some of the usage factors: both Assistants, for the most part, get the job done. If I need my Assistant to do more than answer a quick question or set a reminder, again, I’m gonna pull out the phone, because it is more capable.', 'This is the hardest area for me to choose between the watches. I love Google Assistant. I used it when I had an iPhone. It was the primary reason I wanted to switch to Android. I even bought a flip phone that has it built in. And the fact that I can jerry rig the Samsung watch to have a version of Google Assistant is better than nothing, but outside of performing the basic tasks, Bixby is, well, Bixby. It kinda sucks. But the Google Assistant on Wear OS is not equal to the Assistant on my phone; it can do maybe 90% of what my phone can, but the glaring omissions like not controlling the music it knows my phone is playing makes me feel like it’s jerry rigged on the Fossil watch, too.', 'Winner: Tie, oddly enough. Google Assistant is clearly a better assistant than Bixby, but there are perplexing omissions in Google’s Assistant on the Fossil watch, being unable to do the basic things I expect the watch to do in some cases. And the fact that I can put a version of Google Assistant on the Samsung watch means I can have the best of both worlds. Bixby is shit in a fight, but it gets the basics done.', 'Of course, one of the biggest reasons to get a smart watch is for the fitness aspect of it. And both watches work well enough; each has a heart rate sensor that monitors your every heartbeat. The Samsung watch has a much beefier sensor (like I said, for better or worse I noticed it after it sat on my wrist for hours at a time) with eight different senors staring at your skin, as well as the EKG sensor that hasn’t been activated.', 'Likewise, Samsung’s Health app seems to be much more capable than Google Fit, with more workout routines and things like activity reminders to tell you to get your ass off the couch. One literally popped up while I was writing this comparison; a person pops up on screen that says “Try Standing Up: It’s been almost an hour. Get some fresh air?” From there, you can dismiss the reminder (it will stay as a tiny icon on your watch face until you do stand up), but it also gives you a recommendation to try a stretch.', 'This is where Samsung really shows it’s worth in the Health market; built in work outs. Not only did the Samsung watch measure my activity, it has guided routines built into the watch. This is a fantastic feature for anyone who wants to get fit but hasn’t really done a lot of working out, as not only did the watch recommend something to do (selecting “try a stretch” brought me to a menu of different stretch activities; I chose a torso twist), it then showed me how to do it, and then recorded me doing it. It’s a great feature, but with one caveat; it was very difficult to find these guided workouts on my own. It seems hit and miss which work outs have the guided cartoon character showing you what to do, and which workouts it just assumes you should already know how to do. And to find out which ones come with the guide (complete with a voice over from Bixby, which is enough to make anyone want to stop working out), you have to start the work out and cross your fingers. Seems like a great feature hidden behind a real bummer.', 'Both Samsung and Google Fit can record work out sessions; each have a ton of preset workouts, ranging from the usual (walking, running) to the less common (stroller walking, wheelchair).', 'Samsung’s health app also has places for you to record your own data; you can record how much water you drank, your weight, and what food you ate (Samsung will do all the work for you; you don’t need to know how many calories are in the Bojangles butter biscuit to record it).', 'Google’s perceived win in this area is, once more, the app store. With apps like Cardiogram, My Fitness Pal, and Sleep as Android, the data your watch collects can be tailored to different needs based on the apps you give permission to.', 'But that is more of a perceived win and not an actual win; getting the third party apps to feed their resources back into Google Fit is proving to be… problematic. Sleep as Android successfully captured my sleep, although it didn’t seem to be as accurate as the Samsung; it showed that I spent 95% of my night in deep sleep, where previous nights with Samsung’s health app show relatively little deep sleep, more REM, and even times I woke up in the night. But the Google Fit app seems to be completely unaware that sleep data was recorded, and I’ve yet found a way to bring that information into the Fit app. I’m sure it is doable, but the point here is that the Samsung app works 100% from the moment you turn it on, whereas Google Fit seems to require a lot of time (and separate apps) to start working.', 'Heart health is another area where both offer different options; Samsung has the option to constantly measure your heart rate, where Fossil seems to measure it every couple of minutes. Samsung’s constant measuring has some additional benefits (and additional battery drain), such as detecting an abnormality and reading stress levels (more on that in a moment). But both watches seem to capture the same heart rate; I didn’t see any wild fluctuations or discrepancies from one or the other, even though Samsung’s watch has more sensors packed in. I’m sure the extra sensors do something more for me, but on the surface, I didn’t see any benefit to having the extra tech.', 'The Fossil comes with Cardiogram, which does a much better job of analyzing your heart rate data than Google Fit. Cardiogram also lets you join mRhythm’s heart health research study, where you can let them use your data to fight heart disease (this is optional, you can definitely keep your data to yourself if you prefer), and you can also connect it to your insurance to earn rewards.', 'But again, that’s using a different app from the main fitness app installed on your watch. When it comes to heart health in Google Fit, all you really get is a simple graph that shows where your heart rate went up and down. You don’t get much more in Samsung Health, but it looks like there is more available information with the graphs (yes, you get two in Samsung Health).', 'Both watches also recommend breathing exercises (similar to Apple’s breathe app). For Samsung, this is found in the stress widget or under Stress Level in the Health app on the watch, whereas you will find it either in your apps list as Fit Breathe, or in the main Google Fit app on the watch. Samsung once again does a better job of utilizing the data from this exercise; you can find a graph showing your stress level throughout each day in the phone app, where Google Fit just shows you when you took a breathing exercise and how many deep breaths you took. Once again, Cardiogram does a better job of capturing your heart health data, but it doesn’t seem to know when you’ve taken a breathing exercise beyond the difference in your heart rate.', 'Winner: Samsung. While not quite as good as Fitbit’s app, Samsung Health captures a metric ton of data and utilizes it without the need for third party apps to be installed. It also offers some guided work out routines (though whether or not your chosen work out has one is maddeningly inconsistent). Now that Google has bought Fitbit, there is a solid chance that Google Fit will get a whole lot better (or downright replaced by the Fitbit app).', 'Really, both watches come pre-installed with just about everything you would need. But if you want to look outside what comes in the box, they both offer… well… some apps.', 'Initially I felt that Google’s App Store was going to be better than Samsung’s, but frankly they are both lacking in the app department. I’d still give an edge to Google on this one, though, because there are more mainstream apps available through their store.', 'From the Play store, you can fill up your watch’s storage with Google Keep, Google Maps, Facebook Messenger (although this is really more like a plug-in for notifications; you can’t read your message history), Google Camera, etc. and so forth. Sure, most of those that I listed are Google’s own apps, but they add a lot of functionality to the device. Samsung’s watch can’t download any of the Google apps, but there’s some third party apps to get you through things like navigation and translation. Most likely you can find something to do what you need it to. The Google Play store also has a cool feature where it finds compatible apps for your watch based on what is installed on your phone; for example, I installed Sleep as Android on my phone, and the Play Store on the app recommended I download the same app on my watch. This just made it faster to make sure I had the necessary companion app on my watch.', 'In fact, since the Samsung is designed to pair with Android phones, it’s kind of a shame that there isn’t any support for Google’s core apps. I’ve already talked about the lack of support for Google’s own messaging app and the lack of Google Assistant (outside of the work around), but without the option to install Google Maps or other popular apps that are probably already on your phone, the Samsung watch reminds me eerily of the Window’s Phone- it needs a better app store to survive.', 'But for the most part, I’ve just used the apps that were already available. Alarm clock, flashlight, calendar, NFC payment, etc. Primarily the apps that notify me of things happening on my phone so I don’t have to pull out my phone. For anything else, like taking a note or playing a game, I’d rather use my phone anyway.', 'Winner: Google. Both could use some improvement, but Google has more useful (read: Google) apps available in the store.', 'Both watches have the ability to store music on the watch and even play it back on the built in speakers (as well as over linked Bluetooth headphones), but if you already subscribe to a specific music program, that might dictate which watch is best for you. Both watches come with Spotify installed, but only the Samsung watch can download music for offline listening from your paid Spotify subscription. For the Fossil watch, you can download music from Google Play Music (I assume eventually YouTube Music will replace this, but for now, it is non-existent on Wear OS; thankfully, a subscription to one gets you the other, but unthankfully, there’s no way to move your playlists back and forth just yet).', 'In practice, downloaded music works much better on the Samsung watch, whether this is due to Samsung’s OS or Spotify’s programming, I’m not sure. I could never get music to play from Google Play Music, even with a full wifi connection. Both watches, however, will show music controls for any song played from your phone, even if it is from an unsupported app like Apple Music.', 'Winner: Samsung, if only because offline music with Spotify worked better than offline music with Google Play Music. If you aren’t planning on downloading your own tunes to your watch, either one works as well as the other.', 'What good any of this if the watch is dead on your wrist?', 'The good news is that both watches will get you through the day. But what matters is they day after that.', 'The Fossil watch offers several ways to preserve your battery, including a custom option that lets you choose which features are turned on and off. No matter what I’ve turned off, though, I haven’t gotten much more than a day out of it. On my fullest day, starting with the watch on my wrist with a full battery around 9:30 AM, it was down to the 20’s by midnight. That’s manageable, unless you want to use it for sleep tracking.', 'The Galaxy Watch Active 2, however, has lasted for several days. For example, on a similar full day, I left the house around 3 PM with the watch at 70% (and I hadn’t charged it since the day before), worked my full shift, wore it to bed to let it track my sleep, and wore it all day the next day. By 6:30 PM that next day, it was down to 19%, and I didn’t bother to charge it before I went out to dinner. By 9 PM, it was down to 15% (that’s when it finally prompted me to go into battery saving mode, which I ignored), and I doubt I’ll have to plug it up until I’m crawling into bed.', 'The Watch Active 2 has some battery saving features, but I have yet to turn any of them on, which means the battery in the Samsung lasts a hell of a lot longer with all features enabled than the Fossil does with over half of the features crippled. And frankly, if I have to disable most of the features I bought the watch for in order to avoid charging it before the end of the day, it’s not worth the money.', 'That said, where the Fossil lacks in stamina, it does make up for (slightly) in charging time. The Fossil charges with a little puck that magnetically attaches to the back; it isn’t a wireless charger like the Samsung, but instead two metal prongs connect to the two metal rings that surround the heart rate sensor. I was able to charge the Fossil from 0–100 in roughly an hour, which means if you find yourself with a dying watch (and have your charger with you), you can get some decent usage time by plugging it in for a few minutes.', 'The Samsung watch, by comparison, takes about two hours to reach a full battery from zero using the wireless charging puck that it comes with. It does charge wirelessly, and if you use one of the newer Galaxy phones, you can charge your watch by sitting it on the back of your phone; that doesn’t help me with my Pixel 3a, but it’s worth knowing. Even with a longer charging time, whatever charge you get in the few minutes you plug it in before the next part of your day, the odds of it lasting the rest of that day are higher.', 'For me, battery life is a huge pain point. I hate having devices that I have to charge all the time. If my tech isn’t able to last me through the day without a wall outlet, it drives me nuts. Of course, the odds of me having a day where I’m on the go from morning until night without a chance to plug up are slim, but I prefer a device that I know can hold it’s own when I need it to. But with a smart watch, if it dies before I get home, its not like I’m stranded without a phone. And as it dies, that’s where things get interesting.', 'When the battery is about to die, Fossil puts the watch into “Time Only” mode. This mode is supposed to drastically increase battery life on the watch (on a full charge, it should last about a week in this mode) with one huge caveat: you’re smart watch is no longer smart. It’s just a watch. You get the time, the date, and Fossil’s logo at the press of the crown, and that’s it. Granted, that’s not what you bought the smart watch for, but in a pinch with a dying battery and no place to charge, it keeps your watch from becoming a paperweight.', 'Like I said, I haven’t really needed to use Samsung’s low power mode, so I don’t know how long it will keep my watch until I can juice up. Turning on power savings mode on Samsung gives you a grayscaled screen with time, date, and step count available, while shutting off most other features including raise to wake, the heart rate sensor, Bixby, and all apps besides the phone. You can still access notifications, however, it seems you only access the notifications that you had already received before going into low power mode.', 'It is a bit easier to get out of low power mode on the Samsung than it is to get out of Time Only mode on the Fossil; Samsung puts an “Off” button right on the screen. With a tap, your watch is back to full functionality within a few seconds. On the Fossil, you have to press and hold the crown until the watch restarts. A couple times, I had to slap the watch on the charger in order to get it out of Time Only mode.', 'Winner: Samsung. Samsung’s clearly mastered battery life better than Google, and in most cases you should get two days before you need to consider topping off the battery. That said, the Fossil should see you through most days, and it won’t take as long to recharge when you need to top off the battery. Personally, I’m the type of person who is going to charge it daily anyway; I used to have an Apple Watch. I know how it goes.', 'I wanted to come back to that reminders thing. Because discovering that something so integral to having a smart assistant on your smart watch- and having a smart watch in general- isn’t working and hasn’t been working for almost two years and Google hasn’t bothered to fix it in that amount of time, well, that makes me feel like Wear OS is not the future of smart watches on Android. With their acquisition of Fitbit, Google is planning to revamp (or replace) Wear OS, but who knows what that would mean for this existing Fossil watch and it’s related Wear OS devices. And it also makes me concerned for when something else breaks in Wear OS- frankly I won’t expect a quick fix from Google, if they fix it at all.', 'Samsung, on the other hand, seems very focused on their wearables. I mean, they updated the Watch Active within 6 months with features users were requesting. They are, frankly, trying to be Apple’s direct competitor (and really, they are) and I think they know that their watch has to be to Android what the Apple Watch is to Apple. And you know what? Even with the few things that don’t work 100% on a non-Samsung Android phone, the Samsung Watch Active 2 is about as close as an Android user will get to the Apple Watch.', 'Winner: Who do you think?', 'I talked about apps and I talked about the programs you will need to install to use features like fitness and whatnot, but what about the watch apps themselves? Wear OS for the Fossil watch, and Samsung Wearables for the Samsung Galaxy Active 2.', 'Both get the job done; providing an interface to connect and control certain features of your watch. For Wear OS, that’s about it; you can change watch faces, you can tweak settings, and… well, you’re done. Most of the settings you have to change on the watch, which is fine, but if you’d rather use the larger phone screen to dive deep into certain settings, with Wear OS you are simply SOL.', 'Samsung’s app, however, is another area where it feels like this is meant to be a direct competitor to the Apple Watch. Samsung’s app controls everything about the watch, from your watch faces to your apps and widgets, Samsung Pay, Bixby. It houses the store to install new apps and watch faces, a Find My Watch function, ways to sync music and photos to the watch, and even an SOS mode that sends an emergency text or phone call to a contact of your choice. It feels like a much more fleshed out app, and makes your watch fully customizable without ever having to touch the watch itself.', 'Winner: Samsung. The Wear OS app, by comparison, feels half-baked, like it was designed only out of the necessity of having a companion app.', 'There are some other fun things to mention about these watches, things that may or may not help you decide which one to buy (and hell, I’m writing this half to decide which one to keep).', 'Both watches allow custom watch faces. At a glance, Samsung seems to have better options built in, however, you can download plenty more for either through their respective app stores. If you choose an analog watch face on the Samsung, you get the added benefit of it making a ticking sound just like a real watch (the sound only plays while the screen is on, however, and on some faces the ticking is way too fast).', 'Speaking of app stores, you can access both stores directly from the watch. As I mentioned, Google’s own app store is going to be better than Samsung’s if you are looking for a bunch of apps to customize your watch; personally, I don’t need much more than the basics, because if I need anything more than the features the watch comes with, chances are I’m gonna do it on my phone. But I had some trouble accessing Samsung’s store on the watch. I’m not sure if the issue is software related or because I’m not using a Samsung phone, but every time I tried to access Samsung’s app store, I received an error message. Not to fret, however; for both watches, you can also access the app stores from your phone (for Samsung’s on a non-Samsung phone, you have to go through the Samsung Wear app).', 'And speaking of apps (let’s just keep this train running), you should be aware of exactly what you’ll be required to install to use one of these suckers. For the Fossil watch, the only app you need is Wear OS. You may have to install additional apps for certain services, such as Google Fit, Cardiogram, and Noonlight, but that’s only if you want to use those services. For the Samsung, however, I had to install Samsung Wear to get started, as well as Samsung Accessory Service, a plug in for Watch Active, a separate plug-in for Samsung Pay, and then Samsung Health. I’m not sure how much all those apps and plug-ins hit my phone’s storage (probably not a lot), but it felt like an excessive amount of programs to download to get the watch to function with my phone. And it’s probably just me, but that seems like more room for a problem if one of those apps or plug-ins starts to malfunction.', 'Both watches feature NFC payment options- Google Pay on the Fossil, and Samsung Pay on the Samsung (though it is lacking the Galaxy phone’s ability to mimic the magnetic strip on your card). I found Samsung Pay was a little hit and miss; on some readers it worked fine, and on others it didn’t. It could have been user error; since I was standing in line, I didn’t try to troubleshoot it there and then.', 'The Fossil watch seems to better mirror all of the notifications I get on my phone; some apps don’t appear as options for the Samsung, and so there are a few notifications that I don’t get. They aren’t anything important- usually headlines from Google News or something that I didn’t need to see right away, but when I pull out my phone and see a notification icon that my watch didn’t know about, it is a little disconcerting.', 'I’ve had no connectivity issues with Samsung, but the same can’t be said for the Fossil watch. Every now and then, I turn on the screen to see that the Fossil watch has disconnected. It usually connects right back after a few seconds, but once I had to go in and manually reconnect it to my phone in Bluetooth settings. This probably has to do with the Bluetooth connections each watch has; Fossil uses 4.2, where Samsung uses the newer 5.0. Also, when I first unboxed it, I could only get the Fossil watch to stay connected to WiFi if I stayed on the connection page in settings. I haven’t had the problem since, so maybe the issue was fixed in one of the software updates I received.', 'Both watches feature some sort of a night mode; on the Samsung, pressing the moon icon in quick settings turns on Goodnight Mode, which darkens the screen and keeps the screen turned off until you press a button (so that your watch doesn’t blind you in the middle of the night). This also seems to start sleep tracking if you are wearing the watch. On the Fossil, tapping the watch icon in the quick settings simply turns off the screen until you press a button.', 'Well, that’s really up to you, isn’t it? Personally, I don’t think you can go wrong with either of these watches. Samsung has some clear benefits in certain areas, such as battery life, health tracking, and the user interface, but they tied for me in other areas, like design and usage. And Google outright won in the App category. And though I didn’t speak about it in depth, it’s there throughout the entire battle: Google has better compatibility with Android phones that aren’t made by Samsung.', 'If you need a winner to be chosen, it’s Samsung, but the Fossil’s latest Wear OS watch ins’t lagging behind as far as it used to. Perhaps with Google’s acquisition of Fitbit, Wear OS’ health options might improve over time. But there are major concerns discovering that there are some major issues with Wear OS that have gone unfixed for years. Then again, Google has made some recent promises that Wear OS is going to be receiving more focus. Time will only tell (pun intended).', 'As for me? It’s been a really tough decision. The Samsung watch works better in most categories, however, the Fossil watch works best with my phone. I can’t get over how much easier it is to respond to a text on the Fossil with a full- albeit microscopic- swipe keyboard on the screen (I don’t like speaking my messages, because I primarily use my watch to reply while at work, and speaking to my watch looks weird).', 'The Samsung’s best quality is the fitness aspect, and I need to get fit, but for my uses, it really isn’t better than the Fossil. Google Fit’s ability to link to apps like Cardiogram allow me to tailor my health data to my personal needs. Both watches offer very similar features, including work out tracking and stress relief, and while it is nice that Samsung compiles stress levels into a graph, I also have to think about how much that information really impacts my day to day life: not at all. The same goes for sleep tracking; I’ve actually found it harder to fall asleep knowing my watch is going to grade my slumber.', 'The biggest area for me to consider has been the battery life. When using the Fossil watch, I’ve yet to have a day where it died before my day was done, but I’ve had to charge it every day. That’s not a huge problem for me; I charge all of my devices on a daily basis. And the fact that it charges so quickly (it is charging now, and has gone from 20% to 60% in the last 15 minutes) means that it won’t be long for it to be up and running again if I do need to stop and charge it. The Samsung watch has lasted me between 2–3 days on a charge, but it takes so much longer to charge, which means I honestly haven’t charged it completely to 100% since I got it, because I don’t want to wait on it. It also means I don’t have to worry if I leave the house with it as low as 40%, as I know that will still probably get me through the rest of my day. Fossil’s granular control over what features are turned on and affecting the battery life are great, but I haven’t had to even touch any of Samsung’s features to preserve the battery.', 'It’s been a real struggle (first world problems at their firstiest), and honestly I very nearly went with the Fossil watch simply because of the better compatibility with my phone, the more useful apps, and the faster charging time, despite the shorter battery life. But then, as if I needed a nudge in the other direction, the Fossil watch stopped vibrating or making sounds for notification alerts. As much as I like this watch, with every passing day another quirk shows up that keeps me from wanting to use this watch. So, reluctantly, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 is the watch I’ve chosen to wear. But I really, really hope Google works out all of the kinks with Wear OS, because it’s a platform I’m very interested in using down the road.', 'I hope this in-depth look at two of Android’s better smartwatch offerings helps you make the decision that is right for you.', 'Do you own one of these watches? Are you thinking about buying one? Or do you have something else that you think works that much better? Let me know in the comments.', 'Also, if there’s an aspect of either watch you are interested in that I didn’t touch on in this lengthy back and forth, let me know and I’ll do my best to answer you.']

The markup is really weird at first. CSS some times makes your page beautiful, other times you have no idea why a single property turned your page into a mess. And in case this is your first time working with a programming language, JavaScript might be the most daunting of the three.', 'But, when you finally have a grasp of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, what do you do with them? Practice. Think of something you want to do with your newfound knowledge, it doesn’t matter if it’s “useful”, it doesn’t matter how complex it is. Just do something that helps you get better at HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And please, never forget the value of building dumb sh*t :)', 'Today, as you have already found out from the title, I will be walking you through the creation of a login page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. But don’t worry. Again, as the title says, this is your first login page, which means the code is as simple as possible and there will be an explanation to accompany each piece of code.', 'Before jumping to the code though, let me show you what we will be creating:', 'As you can see, the page contains a title, a login form (for username and password) and a login button that “submits” the input data. Note that I used quotation marks around the submission because there’s no actual submission. Neither the username nor the password are sent to a server to be validated. Instead, when the user clicks the login button we validate that the username is “user” and the password is “web_dev” using JavaScript. If they match, then an alert dialog is shown and the page is reloaded (for the sake of simplicity); otherwise, we display an error message.', 'Now that you’re more familiar with the end result, let’s move on to the code.', 'We’ll start with the HTML, as it is the one responsible for the information displayed in the page. In other words, first we will write and structure all the information contained in the page without worrying for style (CSS) or interactivity (JavaScript). Analyse the complete HTML file for as long as you want and when you’re ready move on to the explanation.', 'As usual in HTML files, we have two parts: the <head> and the <body> . The former includes metainformation about our web page, like the character encoding used, the title of the page (the name you see in the tab of your browser) and references to the CSS and JavaScript files which this HTML file will make use of. Due note that there’s a defer attribute in the <script> tag so that the JavaScript script is only executed after the HTML is fully loaded.', 'In the <body>, we include all the information that will be visible in our page. We use a <main> element to wrap all the content of the page instead of a simple <div> . While <main> and the other semantic elements are functionally the same as <div>s in the sense that they wrap other elements, the former provide the browser more information about the contents of web pages and facilitate the work of tools like screen readers, which are essential to make the web more accessible.', 'Inside the <main> element, that is, the white rectangle, we have all the information seen on the screen: the “Login” title as an <h1> element, a <div> that’s just setting the space needed for the error message (<p>) and lastly, the login form, <form>. This form is made up of three <input> elements: a text field for the username, a password field for the password and the respective form submission button. Using a password as the type of the second field is important so that when the user types its password it shows dots instead of the actual password. Also, note the placeholder attribute. The value you give that attribute is then shown as, you guessed it, the placeholder text of your form fields.', 'By the way, if you’re wondering why the <input> elements are not closed, it’s because they don’t need closing tags (</input> or something among those lines). It’s what we call self-closing tags.', 'Of course, we make plenty use of ids and classes to facilitate our work with CSS. The ids allow us to select HTML elements unambiguously, that is, each id represents a single element of our file. On the other hand, classes are used when we have a set of CSS styles that we want to repeat for multiple elements. We’ll see the practical use of these ids and classes next.', 'Now we have the CSS, in other words, the style of our page. To modify each element in our HTML file, we can select them using ids, classes or the tag names themselves, though the last option is discouraged. You see, the styles of more specific CSS selectors overwrite the styles of less specific ones. For example, the styles of an id selector overwrite those of a class selector, and class selector styles overwrite those of a tag name selector. In other words, always make your CSS selectors as specific as possible to affect only the elements you want to be affected.', 'And don’t forget, while tag name selectors just need the name of the tags, id selectors start with the pound sign (#) and class selectors start with a dot (.). If an element has an id “test-id”, then it can be selected in the CSS by its id using #test-id. If an element has a class “test-class”, then it can be identified as .test-class.', 'With that said, you can still use tag name selectors. For instance, look at the beginning of the code gist. The <html> and the <body> tag names were used as selectors. Though, don’t forget that there’s only one of each of these two elements in a HTML file… In this case, we’ve used those first two rulesets (selector plus everything inside the brackets) to make page-wide modifications. Setting the <html> and <body> height to 100% makes the page use all of the screen and setting the <body> margin to 0 removes any vertical scroll that might appear because of default styles of this element.', 'Still on the <body>, we make it use a grid display to center its contents vertically and horizontally (with align-items and justify-items, respectively). In other words, it takes the contents of the <body>, which are just the <main> element, and positions <main> and its contents in the dead center of the screen. This is called CSS grid layout and if you’re not familiar with it, I’ve written a quick introductory article about it here in case you want to learn more.', 'We’ll use only the most simple grid layout use cases, that is, to make an element use grid display and then position its contents accordingly, but I do recommend looking into the Grid Layout when you can. It’s a simple but powerful tool to position elements in your pages.', 'For <main>, known by its id main-holder (line 15 of the above code gist), we adjust its size and play around with its style to make it stand out from the dark background. We also turn <main> into a grid to facilitate the positioning of its contents which are just three elements: a <h1>, a <div> and a <form>. Thus, by default the CSS makes this a three-row grid, one for each of the elements. In other words, think of the white rectangle as a three-row grid.', 'The first row of the grid, the title, stays as is. The only modification it gets is being centered, as a consequence of the contents of main-holder being centered.', 'The second row on the other hand does get some modifications (lines 26 through 49), as we need to modify both the row itself which contains the error message and then the error message itself. We use the grid layout once again to center the message inside the second row and make the <div> take up all of the available space in its row (remember, by default a <div> is the same size as the elements it contains, so to make it bigger you need to specify its height and/or width).', 'For the error message, we just play around with its size and styles. Due note that initially its opacity is set to 0, that is, it is not visible. This value will be changed using JavaScript when the user enters invalid credentials.', 'We also change the display of half of the text in the error message. If you look back at the message element in the HTML, we have:', 'Notice that <span> element that wraps half of the text. <span> is quite useful when you want to style only part of the text in an element. Because we want the error message to be split in two lines of text, “Invalid username” and “and/or password”, we make the second half show as a new line of text by setting that <span>‘s display to block ( #error-msg-second-line {display: block;}).', 'Now we only need to go through the <form>’s rulesets, the third row of the <main> grid, to wrap up the CSS (line 71 until the end). We start by using the grid layout one last time to turn the <form> into a grid. Though, we also make use of another grid property in its ruleset, #login-form. Since the <form> is a grid item of the <main> element grid container, we can tell it how that grid item should be positioned inside of its own row. Thus, we tell it to be vertically-aligned to the top of its row with align-self: flex-start. Nothing more, nothing less.', 'Then we style the form fields. Since we want both fields (username and password) to look the same, we create a single ruleset which selects the class given to both elements, login-form-field. Instead of selecting each individual element by its id only to repeat the CSS, we write the CSS once in a single class and then give that class to both elements.', 'For the style modifications, those were some slight changes to make these two <input> elements look better. To keep the placeholder text style in line with the <input>s’ style, we also change the colors of those placeholders with the ::placeholder pseudo-element. But, instead of making it general and writing ::placeholder {...}, we specify that we only want to change the placeholders of elements that have the class .login-form-field as such: .login-form-field::placeholder {...}. Again, try to make your CSS selectors as specific as possible.', 'Lastly, we change the style of the login button to make it look better. Nothing new here, except for cursor: pointer which changes the cursor into a pointer when hovering over the button.', 'Okay, we got through the HTML and we just finished the CSS. Now we are in the home stretch with JavaScript.', 'For starters, we get all the elements that we’ll need to work with using JavaScript: the login form, the login button and the login error message. We do it by calling the method document.getElementById, passing it the id of the element we are looking for. Also, since the values of those three variables will not change, that is, the variables will always refer to the exact same elements, then we declare all three as const.', 'After that we create an event listener for the login button, of type click. In other words, every time the login button is clicked, the function defined after ""click"", will be executed. The function receives a parameter that we call e, which is a mouse event that represents the click of the button (naming it e is just a convention of sorts, call it whatever you prefer).', 'Inside the function, we start by preventing the default behavior of clicking the login button (which is to submit the form data). In this demonstration we don’t want to submit the data, we only want to validate it using JavaScript, hence the e.preventDefault() to prevent the submission.', 'Then, we grab the values input by the user in the username and password form fields, respectively. We can take advantage of the JavaScript syntax to select a field of the loginForm form as formElement.nameOfField, where formElement is your HTML<form> andnameOfField is the value given to the name attribute of the <input> element you’re looking for. To get the value of the selected field, just add .value. For example, if the user typed “user01” in the username field, then we’ll get that value with loginForm.username.value. Pretty neat, right?', 'Now the finishing touches. Whenever the user clicks the login button we retrieve whatever values have been typed in the form fields. But we need to do something with those credentials. Then, we’ll write an if/else block to execute a chunk of code if the login credentials are valid or another chunk if they are invalid. We also need a condition, right? Let’s make that condition the actual validation of the credentials. For the sake of simplicity, that validation will check if the typed username is “user” and the password is “web_dev”. In JavaScript syntax, this translates to', 'username === ""user"" && password === ""web_dev""', 'where && is the AND operator that specifies we need both the username to be equal to “user” and the password to be equal to “web_dev”.', 'If the credentials are indeed valid, then we display an alert dialog with the message that the user has logged in with sucess and next reload the page (again, just for the sake of simplicity). But if either the username or the password are not valid, then we change the opacity property of the login error message (loginErrorMsg) to make it visible and let the user know their credentials are invalid. We can make this CSS change within JavaScript by accessing the styles of loginErrorMsg (loginErroMsg.styles) and then the opacity property (loginErrorMsg.styles.opacity) to set it to the value we want. Setting it to 1 means the error message will be fully opaque.', 'And… that’s it. We’ve reached the end of this explanation and now you have a fully functional login page created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I think this is a great idea for the early stages of learning front-end web development as it can be easily improved upon by adding animations, changing the design of the page or making the validation server-side when you learn a back-end language like Node.js, Java, PHP, etc.', 'I hope this article has been helpful for you and by all means let me know your feedback :)', 'If you wish to play around with a live demo, you can find one on repl.it here and the complete code on GitHub here.']"
